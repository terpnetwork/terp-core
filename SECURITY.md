# Security Policy

This repository is managed on github 
Please see https://github.com/CosmWasm/advisories/blob/main/SECURITY.md
for our security policy.

## Feature Request
For a feature request, please use a Github issue. Clearly state the use case and whwat value it will bring to others on Terp Network.

If it is something that can be handled by a param change, discuss it on Discord in the `#governance` channel, and consider a governance proposal.

## Priority Bug

For a bug that is non-sensitive and/or operational in nature rather than a critical vulnerability, please add it as a GitHub issue.

If it is not triaged in a couple of days, feel free to tag `@discoverdefiteam` or `@Xiti922`.

## Critical bug or security issue 
If you are here because you're trying to figure out how to notify of a security issue, go to [Discord] and alert the core development team:

- Austin `returniflost` 
- Xiti `Xiti`

Please avoid opening public issues on GitHub that contain information about a potential security vulnerability as this makes it difficult to reduce the impact and harm of valid security issues.

### Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We ask security researchers to keep vulnerabilities and communications around vulnerability submissions private and confidential until a patch is developed. In addition to this, we ask that you:

- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to correct or address security vulnerabilities.
- Avoid exploiting any vulnerabilities that you discover.
- Demonstrate good faith by not disrupting or degrading Terp Network's network, data, or services.

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

- Once a security report is received, the Terp-DAO core development team works to verify the issue.
- Patches are prepared for eligible releases in private repositories.
- We notify the community that a security release is coming, to give users time to prepare their systems for the update. Notifications can include Discord messages, tweets, and emails to partners and validators.
- 24 hours following this notification, the fixes are applied publicly and new releases are issued.
- Once releases are available for Terp-Core, we notify the community, again, through the same channels as above.
- Once the community is notified, we will pay out any relevant bug bounties to submitters.

This process can take some time. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible. However, it's important that we follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently and to keep Terp Network and the projects running on it secure.

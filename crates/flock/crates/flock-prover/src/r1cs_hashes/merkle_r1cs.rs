//! Merkle-path layout and node-hash spec: the per-path block geometry
//! ([`MerkleTreeLayout`]), the node compression spec ([`HashSpec`],
//! [`blake3_spec`]) and the chunk-leaf path row ([`ChunkPathInput`]) that the
//! recursion tower's Merkle gates and [`super::merkle_glue`] build on.
//!
//! A whole path lives in ONE witness block, so a Merkle path is a legal
//! **table type** for the multi-table union (`flock_core::schedule::TableType`):
//! the union model forbids constraints between rows, so one row is one
//! self-contained path. The monolithic per-path walker circuit that used to
//! live here (`MerkleWalkerCircuit`, the `PathInput` row and the
//! `merkle26+blake3` registry tiers) was retired 2026-08-27 with the
//! Merkle-path product (bloat ledger §C 2.2); the layout keeps the row
//! geometry so the tower's differential Merkle gate still models a
//! full-depth path.
//!
//! ## Statement
//!
//! For a leaf digest `L`, an index `i ∈ [0, 2^depth)`, sibling digests
//! `S_0 … S_{depth−1}` and a root `R`, each level `l` computes
//!
//! ```text
//!   b_l    = bit l of i                       (the indicator bit)
//!   left   = b_l·prev ⊕ (1 ⊕ b_l)·S_l
//!   right  = left ⊕ prev ⊕ S_l
//!   prev'  = H(left ‖ right)
//! ```
//!
//! with `prev = L` at level 0 and `R = prev` after the last level. Over
//! GF(2) the pair `(left, right)` is exactly the conditional swap: `b_l = 1`
//! puts the running digest on the left, `b_l = 0` on the right.
//!
//! ## The chunk-leaf variant (PCS L0 openings)
//!
//! [`MerkleTreeLayout::with_blake3_chunk_leaf`] prepends a **chunk-leaf
//! segment** to the node levels: `leaf_bytes/64` base blocks that hash the
//! raw leaf bytes as one BLAKE3 chunk (`CHUNK_START` on the first block,
//! `CHUNK_END` on the last, chaining through `h_in`, counter 0), whose final
//! chaining value seeds `prev` in place of the leaf-digest global. One row
//! then verifies one PCS L0 opening — leaf hash AND path — under exactly
//! `flock_merkle`'s BLAKE3 tree semantics (leaf = non-root chunk CV of
//! the leaf bytes, node = non-root PARENT compression). Chunk blocks need no
//! gadget columns at all: the base encoder's free message region IS the leaf
//! data, and its chaining-value rows are witness-identical to the pin (block
//! 0: IV) and copy (block `i`: block `i−1`'s output) overrides. The walker
//! is oblivious — chunk blocks embed the same stripped base at their subcube
//! offset, and everything flavor-specific rides in the extras.
//!
//! ## The swap gadget under `C = I`
//!
//! The R1CS is the circuit shape `(A·z) ⊙ (B·z) = z`: every witness column
//! is the output of exactly one row, so a row's right-hand side is a single
//! wire and linear relations need the constant-one wire on the `B` side.
//! `left` is quadratic in the witness, so it needs one AND per bit:
//!
//! ```text
//!   t_j      = b_l · (prev_j ⊕ S_{l,j})     A = [b_l],        B = [prev_j, S_{l,j}]
//!   left_j   = S_{l,j} ⊕ t_j                A = [S_{l,j}, t_j], B = [const]
//!   right_j  = prev_j  ⊕ t_j                A = [prev_j, t_j],  B = [const]
//! ```
//!
//! (`right = left ⊕ prev ⊕ S = t ⊕ prev`, so both halves cost one linear
//! row.) Crucially `left_j`/`right_j` are **not** new columns: they ARE the
//! hash block's 512-bit message region, whose rows the composite *replaces*
//! — the base encoder makes them free inputs, we make them gadget outputs.
//! So the gadget costs only the `2^8` AND columns `t_j` per level.
//!
//! ## Composite layout (`depth = D`, base block `2^κ` wide, `useful_bits = U`)
//!
//! Level `l` occupies the **aligned subcube** `[l·2^κ, (l+1)·2^κ)` — a
//! level's slot IS the base block. The per-level gadget columns and the
//! globals live in the base block's own padding region `[U, 2^κ)`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   per level l, at l·2^κ:
//!     z[l·2^κ         .. l·2^κ + U)       = the hash block, verbatim
//!     z[l·2^κ + U     .. +256)            = sibling S_l         (free input)
//!     z[l·2^κ + U+256 .. +512)            = t_l (the ANDs)
//!   level 0 additionally:
//!     z[U+512]                            = 1     (the table's const_pin)
//!     z[U+513 .. U+769)                   = leaf digest         (free input)
//!     z[U+769 .. U+769+D)                 = index bits b_0..b_D (free input)
//!   every level's tail, and slots ≥ D     = padding (forced 0 by empty rows)
//! ```
//!
//! so `k_log = κ + log2(next_pow2(D))`.
//!
//! **The alignment is load-bearing**, not cosmetic. It makes the level index
//! a set of high address bits, which is what lets the lincheck's `eq` table
//! factor across levels (the retired walker circuit's lincheck relied on
//! that; the tower's differential gate keeps the geometry). Padding each level up
//! to `2^κ` costs ~2.7% more columns than tight packing and does not move
//! `k_log`.
//!
//! Each level embeds the base encoder's block by a **pure column shift**;
//! the composite then overrides exactly three row groups per level: the
//! block's own constant wire (re-derived from the global one), the 512-bit
//! message region (the swap gadget above), and every other free input —
//! the input chaining value, counter, block length and flags — which is
//! pinned to the Merkle node constants. Everything else, every row of the
//! hash relation, is the base matrix with its indices shifted.
//!
//! ## What this does NOT enforce
//!
//! Public-input binding, exactly as in the per-hash encoders: the leaf, the
//! index bits and the root are free witness columns at fixed offsets
//! ([`MerkleTreeLayout::leaf_bit`], [`MerkleTreeLayout::index_bit`],
//! [`MerkleTreeLayout::root_bit`]). The claim-level glue binds them to
//! public values.

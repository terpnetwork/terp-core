//! Describing circuits by *building* them, rather than by hand-writing cells.
//!
//! [`Circuit::new`] takes the wiring as raw equivalence classes of [`Cell`],
//! and the witness is built by separate code. Two artifacts that must agree
//! with nothing enforcing it — a mismatch is a silently wrong *statement*, not
//! a compile error. See `docs/circuit-wiring-design.tex`
//! §"Describing circuits: the builder".
//!
//! The fix is the principle behind [`crate::transcript_record`]: **one
//! description, both views**. A [`GateType`] carries its constraints and its
//! native evaluation together, so instantiating a gate emits the row, the
//! wiring and the witness from a single call and they cannot drift. `counts`
//! and the equivalence classes fall out of construction instead of being
//! passed in.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut b = CircuitBuilder::new(nu);
//! let mult = b.slot(MultGate { kappa });
//! let mut acc = b.public_value(seed);
//! for &a in &multipliers {
//!     let a_w = b.public_value(a);
//!     acc = b.gate(mult, &[a_w, acc])[0];
//! }
//! b.publish(acc);
//! let built = b.finish();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Determinism
//!
//! Rows are allocated in gate-instantiation order and cell-slots enumerate in
//! registry order, so the same sequence of calls always produces the same
//! [`Circuit::digest`]. That matters because the digest is statement-binding:
//! a *regenerated* circuit must be the SAME circuit, not merely an equivalent
//! one.

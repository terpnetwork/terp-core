//! Zerocheck PIOP: prove a(y) · b(y) ⊕ c(y) = 0 for all y ∈ {0,1}^m.
//!
//! Inputs are three bit vectors of length 2^m. Output is an evaluation claim
//! on the multilinear extensions â, b̂, ĉ at the protocol-derived point.
//!
//! Protocol shape (m = log_n, k_skip = [`K_SKIP`] = 6):
//!   1. Verifier samples `r ∈ F_{2^128}^m` (the zerocheck challenge).
//!   2. Prover sends `P^{AB}(λ)` and `P^C(λ)` for λ ∈ Λ, |Λ| = 2^k_skip.
//!   3. Verifier samples `z ∈ F_{2^128}` (univariate-skip fold point).
//!   4. For each of the `m - k_skip` multilinear rounds, prover sends
//!      `(P_r(1), P_r(∞))` and verifier samples `ρ_r`.
//!   5. Prover sends final MLE evaluations `(â, b̂, ĉ)` at the resulting point.

//! Both `prove` and `verify` are wired end-to-end. The prove→verify roundtrip

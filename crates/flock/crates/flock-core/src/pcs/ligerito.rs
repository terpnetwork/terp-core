//! Ligerito: recursive multilinear PCS.
//!
//! Ported from bolt-rs (`ligerito_recursive.rs`) onto Flock primitives. The
//! committed Reed--Solomon words remain in `F128` (GHASH irreducible) and use
//! [`AdditiveNttF128`], while fold challenges and running sumcheck claims use
//! the quadratic extension `F256`. Merkle commitments come from
//! [`crate::merkle`] and Fiat--Shamir from [`Challenger`].
//!
//! Soundness regimes (our paper App. C.3): unique decoding (Thm `ca-udr`,
//! BCHKS25 Cor. 1.4, `Secure` profile) and Johnson list decoding with
//! out-of-domain binding (Thm `ca-johnson`, BCHKS25 Thm 4.6 + Johnson
//! interleaved list bound, `Fast`/`Slim` profiles). See [`SoundnessRegime`].
//!
//! ## Protocol
//! 1. Commit f^0: reshape into `num_interleaved × msg_cols`, RS-encode each
//!    lane to `block_len = msg_cols · 2^log_inv_rate`, merkle over codeword
//!    positions (one position across all lanes = one leaf).
//! 2. Partial-eval f^0 with `initial_k` challenges → f^1.
//! 3. Commit f^1.
//! 4. Open `num_queries` rows of f^0; build induced sumcheck basis poly.
//! 5. For each recursive step i:
//!    a. Run k_i sumcheck rounds.
//!    b. Last step: send remaining poly + open f^i.
//!    c. Else: commit f^{i+2}, open f^{i+1}, induce next basis, glue.

///             MCA/fold arithmetic over F256. Default.

/// Sample `count` positions in `[0, block_len)` via the challenger, **with
/// replacement**: exactly `count` draws, duplicates allowed, returned in
/// sample order (unsorted).
///
/// Shaped for arithmetisation. The old sampler rejected repeats, which cost a
/// `HashSet`, a sort, and an unbounded loop — none of which a circuit can
/// express. All three are gone: this is one fixed-length squeeze followed by a
/// low-bit mask per element, a fully static shape.
///
/// The single `sample_f128_vec` squeeze also matters for the FS chain the
/// recursive verifier has to replay. Per-element `sample_f128` calls are
/// `count` sequentially-dependent duplex rounds (absorb tag, finalize, absorb
/// the 16 squeezed bytes); the batched form is one finalize, one XOF fill —
/// counter-mode, so its blocks are mutually independent — and one bulk
/// re-absorb. At L0 (243 queries) that trades 243 finalizations for **one**,
/// and 243 XOF output blocks for **61**: the old path squeezed 16 bytes at a
/// time and threw away 48 of every 64. Measured over a whole verification
/// (`--features hash-count`, `verifier_hash_count`), the finalization count is
/// where the entire win lands — m=30 rate 2 goes 363 → 106, while absorb
/// blocks and XOF output barely move. Finalizations are also the part that
/// actually serializes, since each squeeze's output is re-absorbed.
///
/// `block_len` is a power of two (it is `2^(log_msg_cols + log_inv_rate)`), so
/// masking the low bits is exact and unbiased — no modular reduction and no
/// rejection needed for uniformity either.
///
/// `count` may exceed `block_len` without harm; the soundness bound
/// (see [`udr_queries`]) is the independent-sample one and never depended on
/// distinctness. Ladder shapes still keep `block_len >= count` — see
/// [`derive_ladder_shape_tuned`] — but that is now a proof-size convention rather
/// than a correctness requirement.

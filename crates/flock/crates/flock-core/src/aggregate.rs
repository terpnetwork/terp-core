//! Aggregating many proofs' matrix work into one accumulator.
//!
//! This is the driver that composes the two halves of the accumulation
//! route: [`lincheck::verify_union_deferred`] replays a proof succinctly and
//! hands back a [`MatrixAssertion`] instead of reading the base matrices,
//! and [`crate::matrix_fold`] folds those assertions' claims into a running
//! [`Accumulator`]. Nobody reads a matrix until somebody discharges the
//! accumulator — once, at the end.
//!
//! **This does not make native verification faster** — measured, batching is
//! several times SLOWER. Folding `k` claims costs `k · nnz` (the row phase
//! builds `g_i` per claim), which is exactly what checking those `k` claims
//! directly costs, plus the final discharge on top. No random-linear-
//! combination avoids it: the combined weight is a sum of `k` rank-1 terms,
//! so every nonzero still needs `k` multiplications. `k` claims at `k`
//! distinct points cost `k` passes over the matrix, full stop.
//!
//! What the fold buys is an ASYMMETRY, and it is worth only one thing:
//! recursion. The fold's PROVER pays that `k · nnz`; the fold's VERIFIER
//! pays `O(κ)` and reads no matrix at all. That moves the matrix work from
//! inside a circuit — where it is nnz-preserving and the fixed point cannot
//! close — to a native prover, where it is ordinary. So this module is the
//! thing a recursion circuit arithmetises.
//! [`verify_aggregate`] touches no matrix, so it is exactly what a merge
//! circuit replays: verify the children succinctly, fold their claims plus
//! the accumulators they carried, output one accumulator. The proof that
//! comes out has the same shape as the ones that went in — a proof plus an
//! accumulator — which is what lets the recursion close.
//!
//! ## What folds with what
//!
//! One accumulator per `(boolean type, matrix)`: `A₀` and `B₀` never mix,
//! because only their α-combination appears in a proof's target and α is
//! per-proof, so a claim about `α·A₀ + B₀` names a different polynomial in
//! every proof. Within one accumulator the fold takes
//!
//! * the claim carried in by each prior accumulator (a merge node's
//!   children each bring one), in order, then
//! * the claim each verified proof emitted (one per proof).
//!
//! So a leaf over two proofs folds `2 → 1`, and a `2 → 1` merge of two
//! recursive proofs folds `4 → 1` (two inherited, two fresh).

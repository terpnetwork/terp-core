# abq — quick paired A/B on a MICRO-BENCH, for kernel-level work.
#
# Why: a full m=32 prove costs ~40 s (MT) or minutes (ST) per invocation, so a
# 3-pair A/B is 10-20 minutes. The zerocheck micro-benches drive the same
# kernels on a synthetic witness with no R1CS build, commit or open — the
# round-2 sweep runs m=16..29 in 0.6 s — and most of them print a CHECKSUM,
# which proves bit-identity for free. Validated 2026-08-31: the round-2 ports
# measured -16.2% on the full ST prove and -19.5% here, in 2 s instead of
# 20 minutes, with identical checksums.
#
# Usage:
#   benchmarks/abq.sh -b round2 -c /Users/buenz/flock-pre2 [-p 3] \
#                     [-e "RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1"] [-a "32 3"] [-g "(best)"]
#
#   -b  bench name (round1 | round2 | rounds3plus | ag_breakdown | ...)
#   -c  control worktree (built at the baseline commit)
#   -p  pairs (default 3)
#   -e  comma-separated env assignments applied to BOTH arms
#   -a  arguments passed to the bench binary
#   -g  grep pattern selecting the metric line (default "(best)")
#   -m  section to measure, for benches that sweep sizes (e.g. -m 29 selects
#       the "=== m = 29" block). Without it the FIRST matching line is used.
#
# Both arms are rebuilt first, then run in ALTERNATING order.
#
# LIMIT — READ THIS. A micro-bench is only a valid proxy if it drives the
# route production takes. round2 and ag_breakdown were converted on
# 2026-09-01 to the SPARSE run-list dispatch at the shipped 92/128 occupancy;
# rounds3plus is still DENSE-only and remains a loop-structure trap.
# Changes to per-pair ARITHMETIC transfer between routes (wideneon/qres read
# -19.5% on the dense bench vs -16.2% on the real prove); changes to LOOP
# STRUCTURE do not — a two-pair unroll measured -3.5% on the dense bench and
# was neutral on the real prove, and the wrong reading cost half a day.
# Confirm anything structural with a full prove.
#
# The full prove now defaults to the AG zerocheck on aarch64 (-5.8% vs RS,
# 2026-09-01); use BLAKE3_ZC=rs to drive the RS arm. Do NOT raise
# FLOCK_SPARSE_GATE for AG — sparse is AG's optimum on both ST and MT.

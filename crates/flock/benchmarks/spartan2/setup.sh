#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup.sh — clone microsoft/Spartan2 and run its SHA-256 benchmarks.
#
# This is the only checked-in file under spartan2/; everything else (the cloned
# repo) is gitignored. It is self-contained so it works from a fresh checkout
# where spartan2/ contains nothing but this script.
#
# The clone is pinned to the same commit the benchmarks/ harness
# measured (override with SPARTAN2_SHA, or SPARTAN2_SHA="" for upstream HEAD)
# so numbers stay comparable across both harnesses.
#
# Two criterion benches; select with SPARTAN_BENCH (default: all):
#   spartan      — `sha256_spartan`: proves SHA-256 of a 1 KiB / 2 KiB preimage
#                  with the T256HyraxEngine (curve-based 256-bit field, Hyrax
#                  PCS). 1 KiB = ceil((1024+9)/64) = 17 sequentially-dependent
#                  compressions; 2 KiB = 33.
#   neutronnova  — `sha256_neutronnova`: NeutronNova folds N SHA-256 step
#                  circuits into one Spartan proof (1 KiB → 16 steps, 2 KiB → 32).
#   all          — both (default).
#   none         — clone/build only, run nothing (CI / setup-only).
#
# Closest Flock comparison (independent SHA-256 compressions; the
# sequential-chain bench was retired with the chain product, 2026-08-14):
#   cargo bench --bench sha2_proof
#
# Thread count: BENCH_THREADS is a comma-separated sweep list consumed by
# Spartan2's bench harness (e.g. "1,4"). Defaults to the performance-core
# count, mirroring Flock's init_perf_thread_pool so the headline numbers are
# compared at the same thread count; set BENCH_THREADS to override.
#
# SPARTAN_FILTER (optional) is passed through as criterion's benchmark-id
# regex, e.g. '^spartan_sha256/(prove|verify)/' to skip the slow setup /
# prep_prove groups. Used by ../bench_sha256.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./spartan2/setup.sh                          # clone (if needed) + run both
#   SPARTAN_BENCH=spartan ./spartan2/setup.sh    # only the Hyrax/Spartan bench
#   BENCH_THREADS=1,4 ./spartan2/setup.sh        # ST + 4-thread sweep
#   SPARTAN_BENCH=none ./spartan2/setup.sh       # fetch + compile only

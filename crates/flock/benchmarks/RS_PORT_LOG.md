# RS-path port log

Record of porting engineering optimizations from the Yukon challenge repo
(`Layr-Labs/flock-challenge` @ `c576e68`) into this tree's RS zerocheck path.
Goal: close the gap while keeping added code minimal, and keep every change
attributable to a measured per-phase delta.

Every number here is `benchmarks/breakdown_phases.sh` at 2^18 BLAKE3 on an
**Apple M1 Max (8 P-cores, 32 GB)**, back-to-back A/B in the same session.

## Baseline (`9793190`) and the target

| phase | ours ST | ours 8T | challenge ST | challenge 8T |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| witness | 351.4 | 81.1 | *not reported* | *not reported* |
| commit | 1277.4 | 196.2 | 1796.7 | 255.9 |
| zc round 1 | 1441.4 | 196.7 | 314.1 | 43.7 |
| zc round 2 | 433.1 | 58.8 | *(combined)* | *(combined)* |
| zc rounds 3+ | 452.4 | 66.4 | 538.2 (r2+r3+) | 78.0 |
| lincheck | 183.4 | 30.6 | 31.9 | 13.4 |
| open | 636.9 | 100.2 | 565.2 | 89.5 |
| **total** | **4781.0** | **723.9** | — | — |

Two caveats on the challenge-repo column, both established with the session
that produced it:

1. Those numbers come from `prove_fast_timed`, which in that repo is a
   structurally separate path from `prove_fast` and measured **~15% slower**
   (405.7-420.7 ms vs 473-484 ms for the same work). Ours agrees with its own
   headline `prove_fast` to within 1.4%, so the two columns are not on equal
   footing. Where the 15% sits is unknown; if it is concentrated in `commit`
   (the dominant phase there, and the one touching its pinned allocation) then
   its commit figure is overstated by a lot.
2. That repo moves work **across phase boundaries** —
   `round1_c_fold4_from_lincheck_stripe` and `stage_c_prelude_for_tail_fill`
   shift C-side work between lincheck and the zerocheck. Its very low lincheck
   number is therefore partly re-attribution, not necessarily a real win.

Treat the column as directional, not as a scoreboard.

Net kept: **round 2 −13.4% ST**, total 4781.0 → 4716.2 ST (−1.4%), for 179
added lines.

## What the negative results tell us

- **Round 1 is not multiply-bound** (attempt 4: reductions cut by a factor of
  `big_lo_size`, products from 6 PMULLs to 3, no movement). An earlier version
  of this log inferred from that "round 1 is gather-bound on the convert
  table". **That inference was wrong.** Measuring the split directly
  (temporary `FLOCK_R1_SPLIT` scaffold, since removed) gives, at 2^18 ST:

  | round-1 component | ST ms | of round 1 | of whole prove |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | `shift_reduce_inner_ab` | ~810 | 56% | 17% |
  | `bit_transpose_64bytes` | ~136 | 9% | 3% |
  | `accumulate_convert` | ~521 | 36% | 11% |

  So the convert-table accumulate is only a third of round 1; the prep pass
  dominates. Reproduce by re-adding two `Instant` counters around the b_med
  prep loop and the `accumulate_convert_with_s_hat_v` call in
  `process_one_x_hi_with_s_hat_v` (per-x_outer_lo granularity; per-b_med timers
  add ~470 ms of their own overhead and only the ratio survives).
- **`shift_reduce_inner_ab` is limited by neither load-issue nor XOR-issue
  count.** Attempts 6 and 7 cut load instructions 4x (8 per byte-pair to 2) and
  XOR ops ~1.75x (56 to 32) respectively; the first cost 12.3% and the second
  1.8%. On Apple cores the four-register structured `LD1` is microcoded and
  loses to four independent 128-bit loads, and `EOR3` bought nothing. What is
  left as the plausible limiter is load *latency* / L1 port pressure against
  the 16 KB inv-NTT table — whose gathers are data-dependent and cannot be
  batched — plus the `gf8_mul_vec16` work. Neither yields to a local rewrite,
  which is consistent with the challenge repo needing specialized and generated
  kernels here rather than a tidier loop.
- **Interface shape can outweigh instruction counts.** Attempt 1 reduced PMULLs
  (4/mul vs binius's 6) and still lost 10%, because `ghash_mul_vec2_neon` takes
  and returns `[F128; 2]` and forces operands through memory. It earns its
  place in the NTT and `f128_slice` call sites only because one operand there
  is a loop-invariant broadcast.
- **Lookahead loses on this hardware.** `cargo bench --bench ag_lookahead_ab`
  (paired, same-process, proofs asserted bit-identical) gives classic 285.9 ms
  vs lookahead 307.2 ms ST at m=30 — lookahead faster 0/4 runs. The code's own
  comments target an M4; do not port it to the RS tail on an M1 without
  re-measuring.
- **Our `commit` is already ~1.4x faster than theirs** (1277 vs 1797 ms ST),
  plausibly from #29/#30 which `c576e68` predates. Cross-pollination runs both
  ways; commit is not a target for us.

## Where the branch ended up

Three changes kept, everything else reverted with its measurement in the commit
message. Against `9793190` (the harness-only commit, before any optimization),
2^18 BLAKE3 ST, paired n=8 with alternating arm order:

| level | base | head | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| round 1 (`round1 URM`) | 1477.30 ms | 1023.72 ms | **-30.7%**, each step 8/8 |
| round 2 (`round2 fused fold`) | ~433 ms | 311.56 ms | **-28%** (WideNeon + q-resident) |
| rounds 3+ (`rounds 3+ tail`) | ~455 ms | 306.56 ms | **-33%** (fused one-pass q-resident) |
| end-to-end headline | ~52,400 comp/s | ~58,100 comp/s | **~+11%**, 8/8 (clean-band read; per-pair delta stable +9.6..+12.4% even through throttled pairs) |

(Supersedes the interim +5.1% figure from the four-win state. The final run was
taken with an active browser session; pairs 4-8 form tight bands on both arms
and cross-check against the predicted sum of the individual wins, ~+7.9%.)

Caveat on the end-to-end figure: the base arm spread that run was wide
(46894-51655, ~10%) while head was tight (51231-53209), so the point estimate is
soft even though the sign test is not. The round-1 number is the better
measured of the two.

The seven kept changes:

1. **Round-2 NEON register accumulator** (~179 lines) -- `WideNeon`, a 256-bit
   product held as two uint64x2_t instead of the GPR-resident F256Unreduced.
   -13% on `zc_round2`.
2. **Structurally-zero b K-row skip** (~10 lines) -- see above. Part of the
   -5.0%.
3. **Two lanes per drain iteration** (~50 lines) -- see above.
4. **Unreduced pmull accumulate + x^K weight split** (~80 lines) -- the
   challenge repo's top-attributed AB-prep mechanism, ported as an idea.
   -128 ms on round 1 by itself (1401.4 -> 1273.4, 8/8, predicted 100-130 from
   their attribution).
5. **Stripe-fold C side** (~150 lines) -- round-1 C banks from one multilinear
   fold of the lincheck stripe; drain AB-only, C transpose deleted. -72.7 ms.
6. **q-resident round 2** (~120 lines) -- fold outputs stay in q registers,
   in-register karatsuba mul_q, WideNeon fed directly. -46.6 ms (-13.0%).
7. **Fused q-resident rounds-3+ tail** (~90 lines) -- fold and message in one
   pass; the second read over multi-MB chunks deleted. -142.9 ms (-31.8%),
   the largest single win. Two earlier failures on this exact loop (pair-mul
   kernel +10%, WideNeon-alone 0%) had located the cost in the pass structure
   and struct crossings, not the arithmetic.

## What bounds each round-1 kernel (measured, not inferred)

Five local rewrites of round 1 have now failed. Taken together they say
something fairly precise about the two kernels, which is more useful than any
of the individual results:

- **The drain is bound by gather COUNT.** Doubling gathers (48 → 96 per lane)
  while shrinking the hot table 8x (64 KiB → 8 KiB) cost 3.6%. M1 has 128 KiB
  of L1D per performance core, so the 256-row convert table already fit and
  there was no footprint problem to fix. Calibrating from that regression, the
  drain's 48 gathers/lane are worth roughly 170 ms of its ~521 ms.
- **The prep kernel is bound by neither load-issue nor XOR-issue count.**
  Cutting load instructions 4x (LD1 x4) cost 12.3%; cutting XOR ops 1.75x
  (EOR3 pairing) gave +1.8%. Deferring its reduction entirely moved nothing.
- **And it is not bound by anything the witness's structure could unlock.**
  Byte statistics of the packed BLAKE3 witness at 2^12 blocks:

  | buffer | zeros | dominant byte | all-0xff rows | uniform 8-byte rows |
  |---|---:|---|---:|---:|
  | a | 6.6% | — | 0.0% | 5.9% |
  | b | 6.1% | **0xff at 28.9%** | 9.4% | 15.3% |
  | z | 12.6% | — | 0.0% | 5.9% |

  `b` is strikingly non-random, which is presumably why the challenge repo has
  a `static_b` / `mixed_const_b` / `single_k0_static_b` kernel family. But the
  0xff bytes are scattered inside mixed rows rather than clustered: only 9.4%
  of b's aligned 8-byte rows are uniformly 0xff, and the 5.9% all-zero rows
  (identical in all three buffers) are padding that `b_med_counts` already
  skips. Row-level constant specialization is therefore worth ~4% of prep
  loads here -- order 10 ms -- not the 262 ms of the AB-prep gap.

The uncomfortable implication: their AB prep is 548 ms against our ~810 ms
while doing strictly MORE memory work (it streams 512 MiB out through
non-temporal stores; ours writes a 1 KiB L1 scratch). So their kernel is
genuinely ~1.5x better code at the same computation, and none of the
structural explanations we can test account for it. That points at
`fused_apply_one_k_fast` / `fast_shift_reduce_with_policy` / the 839-line
generated `aarch64_bstatic_gen.rs` -- i.e. the specialized-and-generated
kernel zoo, which is exactly the bloat this effort set out to avoid.

## Anatomy of the remaining zerocheck gap (from the challenge-repo session)

The session holding the c576e68 checkout read its own kernels and explained the
mechanisms behind each sub-phase advantage. Recorded here because the *shape*
of each answer matters for what upstream should do next.

**AB prep (548 vs ~770 ms): one real arithmetic-kernel win.** Their
`fused_apply_one_k_fast` replaces the incumbent's per-lane REDUCED GF(2^8)
multiply (`gf8_mul_vec16`) with an UNREDUCED carry-less multiply (raw
PMULL/PMULL2) and defers all reduction into an incremental Horner fold
(`acc = acc*x XOR lo XOR hi`, one fused BCAX per step, precomputed carry
constant x^16 mod p = 0x5e). Same gathers, same passes; cheaper arithmetic.
~50-60% of the prep gap, per their attribution. The rest is traffic: zero-copy
views into the precompute buffer instead of a per-row scratch memcpy
(DIRECT_AB_ROWS) and skipping the zero-fill of dead tail rows
(AB_COMPACT_STORE). This is the one honest kernel-quality gap, and it is
portable as a technique.

**Round-1 drain (314 vs ~590 ms): structural — they do not run this
computation.** Their active path never reads c_packed, never bit-transposes,
never touches the convert table. Because C = I (C aliases z), the round-1
C-claim derives from the LINCHECK STRIPE via an eq-fold
(`partial_fold_packed_z_best`) plus ring-switch's own fold8
(`s_hat_v_fold8_from_z_vec`), a small quad fold, and one collapse to the
two-half s_hat_v_c layout. This refines the "stripe dedup does not exist"
section below: the index algebra there is correct — the stripe cannot feed
*this tree's drain shape* — but they compute the same OUTPUT by a different
algorithm, so the dedup exists at the algorithm level, not the buffer level.
Their per-lane gather cost model simply does not apply. (Unresolved caveat:
part of their 314 ms may be a Metal GPU prefix they could not isolate.)

Decomposition of OUR 590 ms drain, all measured: ~136 ms C bit-transpose,
~75 ms per-lane eq multiplies (timing probe: removing the muls took round 1
from ~1403 to ~1330 ms), ~380 ms gathers+XORs.

**Rounds 2+ (538 vs ~800 ms): NOT lookahead — lookahead is a shared regression.**
At our request they kill-switched their sumcheck lookahead on their own machine:
591 -> 514 ms with it OFF (13-15% loss when on, all 6 paired samples),
matching this tree's M1 measurement (285.9 vs 307.2 in the AG tail). It is
default-ON in their tree and loses on both chips. Cascade2/cascade3 (composed
double-folds via a 32 KiB rho byte table) was the initial candidate for their
remaining rounds-2+ edge, but a follow-up kill-switch run on their machine says
otherwise: with cascade OFF and lookahead ON, rounds 2+ measured ~736 ms avg
(noisy, 612-964, low confidence), while their fastest configuration remains
lookahead fully OFF (~514 ms) -- where cascade structurally never fires, since
it requires lookahead. So their rounds-2+ advantage over this tree's ~800 ms
lives in the BASE per-round kernels: the register-resident wide-arithmetic
family in their multilinear kernels (2779 lines against this tree's 56; the
same family our round-2 WideNeon win was one piece of), not the fusion
machinery. Cascade's own contribution could not be cleanly isolated.

Direct consequence for THIS tree: the ligerito OPEN runs the same lookahead
family by default (landed in #30, presumably tuned on the M4 Max reference
machine) with the kill-switch `LIG_LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE=1`. Measured separately —
see below if a result was recorded.

**Connective tissue:** a size-classed scratch allocator (take_f128/give_f128)
recycling large buffers across prove calls; the same recycle-don't-allocate
pattern as their largest historical non-GPU win.

Net revision to the earlier "no big idea" conclusion: the gap is NOT dozens of
micro-tunings. It is one structural algorithm change (drain), one arithmetic
kernel (prep), one fusion family (rounds 2+), plus a shared lookahead
regression that is an upstream opportunity rather than a deficit.

## The lincheck-stripe dedup does not exist (checked, closed)

The most promising remaining idea was that `z` gets transposed twice -- once
into the lincheck stripe, once again by round 1's `bit_transpose_64bytes` --
and that round 1 could read its C input out of the stripe instead, deleting
~136 ms of transpose plus the ~113 ms of C gathers it feeds. The challenge
repo's active path is even named `round1_c_fold8_from_lincheck_stripe`.

It does not work: the two byte-groupings run along different axes. Traced by
setting one logical witness bit at a time (m=18, k_log=14):

| byte | logical bits feeding it | stride |
|---|---|---:|
| round-1 C `[b_med=0][lane=0]` | 0, 64, 128, ..., 448 | 64 |
| stripe `[byte_idx=0][i_inner=0]` | 0, 16384, ..., 114688 | 16384 |

With `logical = i_inner + i_outer·K` and `K = 2^14`, round 1's byte runs along
logical bits 6-8 (three of the within-block inner dims) while the stripe's runs
along `i_outer`'s low three bits, logical bits 14-16. Disjoint. Converting one
grouping into the other is precisely the transpose we wanted to skip.

Two corollaries:

- The challenge repo does not avoid this transpose either. Its C drain still
  calls `bit_transpose_64bytes` into a local scratch (confirmed by the session
  that has that checkout), so `..._from_lincheck_stripe` names the buffer it
  reads, not an avoided pass.
- The z transpose is already better handled here than "in parallel" would be:
  `generate_witness_with_ab_packed_and_lincheck` fuses it into witness
  generation, bit-transposing z u64s into the stripe while they are still hot
  in L1, and replaces the standalone `pack_z_lincheck_from_packed` on the fast
  path. Splitting it out to overlap it would add a 512 MiB DRAM round trip to
  buy concurrency on an already-saturated pool -- the same trap as the AB
  hoist. The remaining `pack_z_lincheck_from_packed` call sites are the generic
  `prove_ligerito` path only.

## The lincheck gap is re-attribution, and its fold has no reachable headroom

Their lincheck is 32 ms against our 183 ms -- the largest ratio in the table
(5.7x) and the row we explored last. It is not a real gap.

**Physics.** `partial_fold_packed_z_neon_*` is byte-table driven: per input byte
it loads the byte, loads a 16-byte `build_sum_table` entry, and XORs into an
accumulator pinned in a Q register. At the 2^18 BLAKE3 shape z_packed is 512
MiB, so 2^30 loads. M1 sustains ~3 loads/cycle, giving a floor of ~112 ms
(~84 ms allowing for the `useful_bits` padding skip). Their 32 ms works out to
**0.19 cycles per input byte**, roughly 3.5x below that floor, and even a
16-bit-table variant (two bytes per lookup) only floors at ~0.34. So their
lincheck cannot be performing this fold -- the C-side fold is presumably
computed in round 1 from the stripe and reused, consistent with the active path
being named `round1_c_fold8_from_lincheck_stripe`.

Correcting for this, the real comparable gap is ~970 ms, not ~1120 ms.

**And the genuine headroom is not reachable.** Our fold does sit 1.6-2.2x above
its own floor, but:

- It is insensitive to blocking. `FOLD_AB=1` A/Bs the size-aware dispatch
  against forced `iblock` interleaved per m: 0.988x at m=26, 0.972x at m=28,
  0.994x at m=29. Both strategies land within 3%.
- The only load-reducing transform is arithmetically dominated. `build_sum_table`
  builds 256 entries with 255 XORs by doubling; a 16-bit table needs 65535 XORs
  to enable only `k = 2^14 = 16384` lookups per stripe, so the build costs 4x
  more than it saves. (And the two stripe bytes for one `i_inner` are `k` bytes
  apart, so forming a u16 index needs two loads regardless -- loads would go
  4 -> 3, not 4 -> 2.) It could only pay at much larger `k_log`.

**Stale comment worth fixing.** `benches/lincheck.rs` documents oblock beating
iblock by "≈1.4-1.7x by m=28-29 at this k_log". That does not reproduce here --
see the ratios above. Whoever tuned `OBLOCK_MIN_N_LOG = 16` did it on different
hardware or the win has since regressed; do not trust that comment on M1.

**Also closed for free:** the geometric eq-build (`build_eq_table_optimized` in
their tree, prototyped here in `benches/eq_build_probe.rs`). Running that probe
shows the entire `SplitEqGhash::new` at the round-2 shape costs 0.13 ms, and the
geometric variant is *slower* than the standard build at 5 of 6 sizes. Worth
approximately zero.

## The measured round-1 decomposition (post-stripe-C), and what it closed

A second FLOCK_R1_SPLIT probe (since removed) replaced the estimated
decomposition with a measured one and immediately found a defect:

| component | estimated | measured | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| AB prep | ~640 | ~715 | 90% gathers: a gathers-only probe put the whole multiply tail at ~67 ms, killing the h4-Horner port idea (ceiling ~15 ms for ~100 lines) |
| stripe fold | ~180 | **340 -> 166** | was calling the PORTABLE fold; `partial_fold_packed_z_best` (lincheck's tiled NEON dispatcher) halves it -- the portable kernel's length-k accumulator is 256 KiB at k_log=14, twice M1's L1D |
| AB drain | ~340 | ~167 | near its gather floor all along; the estimate that made it look like a target was wrong |

With the dispatcher fix, drain+fold is ~333 ms against their ~314 --
effectively at parity (and theirs may include an unquantified Metal prefix).
The entire remaining round-1 gap (~150 ms after word-extract, if it lands)
is AB-prep gather machinery, where the remaining lever is the static-b
partial-load import previously ruled out as bloat.

Zerocheck like-for-like standing: ~1643 vs ~1376 = **1.19x** (was 1.74x
fairly accounted, "2.7x" as first misread). Rounds 3+ (1.03x) and drain+fold
(1.06x) are closed; round 2 (1.45x, ~97 ms, their compact-fold mechanism) is
the largest remaining relative gap.

## Machine-specific tunings: three inversions/nulls on M1

Mechanisms measured good on the challenge tree's M4 that fail on M1:
oblock fold gating (comment claims 1.4-1.7x, measures 0.97-0.99x here),
zerocheck-tail lookahead (default-ON there, loses 7-15% on BOTH machines),
and STNP output stores (+1.2% there, **+12% regression** here -- the
non-temporal hint costs store throughput on M1 instead of saving RFO
traffic). Port memory-system hints only with a local paired measurement.

## Final ST+MT comparison vs the session baseline (lightweight, 2026-08-25)

Single instrumented invocation per cell; untouched phases (witness, commit,
lincheck, open) matched across arms to <1% at both thread counts, validating
the run. All 13 kept optimizations, vs `9793190`:

| phase | ST base | ST head | delta | 8T base | 8T head | delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| zerocheck | 2357 | 1638 | **-30.5%** | 322 | 221 | **-31.4%** |
| -- round 1 | 1465 | 961 | -34% | 191 | 129 | -33% |
| -- round 2 | 437 | 304 | -30% | 59 | 41 | -31% |
| -- rounds 3+ | 454 | 310 | -32% | 65 | 48 | -26% |
| **headline** | 52.5k | **62.5k c/s** | **+18.9%** | 349k | **406k c/s** | **+16.1%** |

The MT columns are the first multithreaded measurement since any optimization
landed: every win transferred to 8T at essentially its ST magnitude, and the
end-to-end gain in the threaded (production/scored) configuration is +16%.

Known anomaly, comparison-safe: the open phase measured ~850 ms ST on BOTH
arms today vs ~636 in earlier sessions -- a day-scale bimodality also seen
once before (the 857 ms lookahead-test reading). Same on both arms, so no
delta is affected; flag for the commit/open campaign.

## Cross-tree comparisons: GPU-status-uncertain (major caveat, 2026-08-25)

The challenge-tree session re-ran its own round-2 measurement (identical
config, same machine, days apart) and got **342 ms where it had reported
215** -- a 127 ms swing it flagged rather than explained away. Its raw dump
shows round-1 samples of 92-95 ms jumping to 309 ms MID-RUN with no code
change. 92 ms is implausibly fast for its CPU drain+fold; it is exactly what
its Metal GPU round-1 prefix produces, and that prefix "fires if the shape
matches and Metal's available" with no warmup latch. The Metal-assist hypothesis was TESTED AND REFUTED as a complete explanation:
with both GPU arms force-disabled (FLOCK_NO_GPU_ZEROCHECK=1 and the separately
gated FLOCK_NO_GPU_ZC_R2=1), their first samples remained chaotic (a 1182 ms
round-2 with no GPU involved). The broader driver: this shared machine ran
builds and benches from three concurrent Claude sessions that day, plus
ambient load. Widen the caveat from GPU-status to: fine-grained (sub-100 ms)
cross-tree bucket deltas from this date are unresolvable, period.

Consequences for this log:
- Every "theirs" column in the cross-tree tables is soft until their GPU
  test reports. Their bracket accounting itself was verified clean (buffer
  takes, tables, and padding all inside their round-2 timer; their tail
  honestly carries the compact-format reconstruction).
- What the stable window of their full-GPU-off run DOES support (samples 3-7,
  tight): their pure-CPU round 2 is 274-285 ms against our same-conditions
  305, i.e. a residual of ~27 ms -- the size of their compact format's
  modeled store saving (~25 ms), the one mechanism deliberately not ported.
  The original "90 ms gap" therefore decomposes as ~25 ms format + ~65 ms
  measurement conditions. Their tail (300-307) matches ours (307) exactly.
  Coarse conclusion that survives all of this: the trees are within ~10% on
  the zerocheck CPU-vs-CPU, and bucket deltas below ~50 ms cannot be
  adjudicated on this machine this week.
- Every KEPT win in this log is unaffected: all were internally paired A/B
  on this tree alone and never depended on their numbers.

## The SHA-256 cross-circuit control

Question: is the challenge repo's remaining advantage BLAKE3 specialization
(its static-b census, degen flags) or generic kernel quality? Control: SHA-256
at 2^16 (m=31), ST, identical command on both trees, where neither side's
structure guards fire at their tuned density.

| tree | best prove_fast | throughput |
|---|---:|---:|
| this branch | 2.05 s | 32,027 h/s |
| challenge (c576e68 frontier) | 1.72 s | 38,170 h/s |

Their advantage on SHA-256: **1.19x** -- statistically the same as the ~1.16x
comparable whole-proof gap on BLAKE3. Conclusion: their edge is uniform,
circuit-agnostic kernel quality (commit path, round-2 compact/NT stores, prep
tail, allocator recycling), and the BLAKE3-specific structure machinery is
performance noise at end-to-end scale on both sides -- consistent with their
own per-switch ablations (1-3% each) and with our ports of that family
(zero-skip -42 ms; b===1 degen null).

Also measured by the control: this branch's campaign improved SHA-256 by
**+18% for free** (27.1k -> 32.0k h/s vs the session-baseline matrix) --
no SHA-specific work was ever done, confirming the kept wins are
circuit-agnostic. The b===1 degeneration port (row 21, reverted) was the
last BLAKE3-structural candidate; with this control there is no reason to
pursue that family further.

## What finally worked, and why

Two round-1 wins landed after eleven failures, and they share a property none
of the failures had: they change **how much work exists** or **how much of it
can be in flight**, rather than how the same work is encoded.

**1. Skip structurally-zero b K-rows (−42.4 ms, 8/8).** A census of the packed
BLAKE3 witness -- 256 word positions per block, 256 blocks, 3 independent
witnesses -- found the circuit pins 38 of 256 8-byte b K-rows regardless of the
inputs, taking only three distinct values:

| value | positions | |
|---|---:|---|
| `0xffffffffffffffff` | 22 (8.6%) | const-one wires |
| `0x0000000000000000` | 15 (5.9%) | structural zeros |
| `0x0001ffffffffffff` | 1 | |

33.7% of all b bytes are fixed, cross-checking the byte histogram (28.9% 0xff,
6.1% zero) from the other direction. The zero case is the strongest: the
inv-NTT transform is F_2-linear, so row(0) = 0, so db = 0, so
y = gf8_mul(da, 0) = 0 and the K-row contributes nothing at all --
`fused_apply_one_k` returns immediately, skipping all 64 table loads and the
four F_8 multiplies. One u64 compare, no census data shipped, no position
tracking, and a disagreeing witness falls through to the generic path.

This is strictly better than the challenge repo's `static_b` fast path, which
still loads a precomputed partial for these rows.

**3. Unreduced pmull accumulate in the prep kernel (−128.0 ms, 8/8) — the
largest single win of the effort, and the challenge repo's own top-attributed
mechanism, ported as an idea (~80 lines).** `gf8_mul_vec16` spent 6 PMULLs per
K-row per block — 2 for the raw product, 4 for a reduction that was redundant,
since the accumulator gets one final reduce anyway. Now the raw product
accumulates unreduced, with the x^K row weight decomposed as x^4 (a pre-scaled
second table image to gather from — F_2-linearity makes scaled entries scale
the XOR-sum) times x^2 (a 6-op byte-mul) times x^(K&1) (a u16 shift). Terms
reach degree 15; both reducers were verified exact over the full 16-bit domain
first (exhaustive tests now permanent in gf2_8). Predicted 100-130 ms from the
challenge session's attribution; measured 128.

**2. Two lanes per drain iteration (−63.1 ms, 8/8).** The drain carries three
XOR chains per lane, each of depth `n_b_med` = 16. The gathers feeding them are
independent but the accumulations are serial, so one lane exposes only three
chains. Interleaving a second doubles that to six with no change in work.

**The all-ones case is the instructive failure.** Predicted ~27 ms from the
zero case's calibration; delivered 6.1. Halving a row's loads halves its
memory-level parallelism at the same time, and the remaining dependency chain
goes latency-bound -- the same mechanism that sank the LD1 x4 attempt. Whole-row
elimination avoids it because no chain survives. That result is what motivated
the lane unroll, which then outperformed the win that inspired it.

**Two censuses that closed leads without any code:**

- `a`-side pinned zeros are *exactly* the same 15 positions as `b`'s (union 15,
  a-only 0) -- the padding rows where both operands vanish. An a-side check
  would add nothing.
- The zero words cluster into the block tail (parity 1, b_med 14-15), giving
  only one fully-zero `(parity, b_med)` group of 32, worth ~1% of drain
  gathers. Whole-`b_med` elimination is not there.

**Combined effect, measured directly.** The two wins together, against the
pre-zero-skip commit in a single session, paired n=8 with alternating arm
order:

  round1 URM  base median 1477.30 ms -> head median 1403.07 ms
              -74.2 ms (-5.0%), head 8/8, ranges disjoint
              (base min 1469.55 > head max 1433.81)

That is less than the 42.4 + 63.1 = 105 ms the individual measurements suggest,
and the combined figure is the one to trust: it is the only one where both arms
ran under the same conditions. The individual runs were taken in different
sessions, and cross-run drift on this machine is large enough to swamp the
difference -- identical code measured 1420 ms in one run and 1483 ms in another.

**Methodology that made these findable.** Earlier attempts were measured on the
end-to-end headline, where a 40 ms effect is ~1% and sits under the noise. These
were measured on `round1 URM` directly via `FLOCK_ZC_TIMING`, taking the min
across the ~5 zerocheck calls in a run, 8 alternating-order pairs per verdict --
about 3x faster per sample and aimed at the phase actually being changed. Note
cross-run drift remains large: the same code measured 1420 ms in one run and
1483 ms in another, so only within-run paired deltas are trustworthy.

## Not attempted, and why

- Anything GPU-gated (`partial_fold_packed_z_best_gpu_split`,
  `ranked_lincheck_fold_gpu_shape`) — out of scope by request.
- The `Round1AbInner` staged pipeline, `c_fold4` mask tables, static-B
  specialization and its 839-line generated kernel. This is where the round-1
  win actually lives, but it is ~6000 production lines across
  `univariate_skip_optimized.rs`, its NEON kernels, and `zerocheck.rs`.
- `build_eq_table_optimized` in lincheck. The geometric-medium trick is
  prototyped in `benches/eq_build_probe.rs` but never landed; lincheck is only
  3.9% of ST here and its cross-repo gap is partly re-attribution (see above),
  so it was not the best next move.

## The cross-repo round-1 comparison was never like-for-like

This is the most important correction in this log. The challenge repo's
round-1 figure **excludes its AB precompute**. `commit_with_round1_ab_precompute`
in its `prover.rs` runs

    rayon::join(commit_arm, precompute_ab_arm)

so `precompute_round1_ab_inner_packed_padded` — the same
`shift_reduce_inner_ab` work that is 56% of our round 1 — lands in its *commit*
bucket, and its `t.commit_s` wraps the whole join. Comparing their 314 ms
round 1 against our 1444 ms was comparing a drain against a prep-plus-drain.
Combined:

| phase | ours ST | theirs ST |
|---|---:|---:|
| commit | 1277.4 | 1796.7 |
| zc round 1 | 1444.3 | 314.1 |
| **commit + round 1** | **2721.7** | **2110.7** |

The honest gap is ~611 ms, not ~1130 ms. An earlier claim in this log that
"our commit is already ~1.4x faster than theirs" was wrong for the same
reason — they do strictly more work in that phase.

We implemented the same architecture to check whether it is a speedup or an
accounting choice, and it is the latter. The transform really is
challenge-independent (the challenge reaches round 1 only via `eq_lo_scaled`
and the convert table, both owned by the drain), a
`[x_outer][b_med][64]` buffer lets the drain consume it by borrowing with no
copy, and the result is bit-identical. But:

- **ST is a wash.** `rayon::join` is sequential on one thread, so the locality
  won by no longer interleaving AB with the C transpose and the 64 KB
  convert-table drain is spent again on a 512 MiB write plus 512 MiB read the
  interleaved version never did. Non-temporal `stnp` stores, which skip the
  read-for-ownership on that write-once surface, did not change it.
- **8T is a wash.** Both join arms compete for the same saturated pool, so
  there is no idle capacity for the overlap to fill.

Measured three ways (ST paired n=8 order-alternating with NT stores: base
53288 vs 53037, base 5/8; 8T paired n=6: 325007 vs 320655, base 4/6; ST
paired n=10 without NT stores: indistinguishable once warm). Reverted.

**Methodology note worth keeping: check the power source before measuring.**
Two grand-total runs were invalidated in one evening by power state. On low
battery, macOS caps frequencies (one base arm carried a sample ~20% low); while
fast-charging a nearly-empty battery, it is even worse -- the charger's power
budget is shared with the SoC and a paired run swung -13% to +57% per pair
with a 51% base-arm spread. Run `pmset -g batt` first: measure only on AC with
the battery above ~60%, where the charge rate has tapered. The alternating
paired design protects the sign test through slow drift (arms sit within ~80 s
of each other), and min-of-5 within a run rejects transient dips -- which is
how the round-1 results cross-validated and survived -- but end-to-end
magnitudes from a throttled window are unusable.

**Methodology note worth keeping.** An earlier version of the paired script
always ran the base arm first. Throughput declines monotonically across a run
as the machine heats (342707 → 315100 over six 8T pairs), so a fixed order
biases the comparison by roughly the size of the effect being measured. Always
alternate which arm runs first, and discard a warm-up of each arm — an
apparent +3.3% win for the hoist evaporated once both were done.

## The idea behind their `accumulate_convert` win

Worth recording even though it did not transplant, because the algebra is the
interesting part. Their C-side drain does **no table gathers at all**.

`convert[b][v] = γ^b · φ_8(v)`, and **γ = X** — the comments confirm it, the
rows are built by `mul_by_x` doubling. So `Σ_b γ^b · (bit_b)` is *literally* a
16-bit mask in the field's coefficient representation: `F128 { lo: mask }`.
Since `φ_8` is F2-linear, the per-lane C contribution decomposes over the 8 bit
positions of the byte into 8 such masks — the "eight-bank C drain" — each
accumulated with pure bit operations. The only field work left is one multiply
by `eq`, and `F128 { lo: m } * eq` is itself F2-linear in the mask's 16 bits,
so even that becomes `T_lo[m & 0xff] + T_hi[m >> 8]` from tables built **once
per prove** and shared read-only (8 MiB at their shape; building per call would
cost ~4 GiB of L1 stores).

Why it does not transplant on its own: profitability depends on data layout,
not just the algebra. Building the masks needs one lane's bytes gathered
*across* `b_med`, but `chunk_c_bytes` is `[b_med][lane]`, so extracting them
costs exactly the 16 strided loads the trick was meant to remove. Their
pipeline gets the transposed layout for free from the `Round1AbInner`
precompute pass. The AB side is handled separately by the tensor split
`eq.lo[(w << s) | u] · D^-1 == eq_top_scaled[w] · eq_bot[u]`, pre-scaling the
convert tables by `eq_top` so the inner loop is pure XOR with no per-lane
multiply, keeping `2^s` bank accumulators and applying `eq_bot` once at the
end.

Any future round-1 attempt should start from the layout, not the algebra.

## Note on the geometric trick

The three layered optimizations in `univariate_skip_optimized.rs` — geometric
small-eq + shift_reduce, geometric medium-eq + 64 KB convert-table lookups, and
D^-1 absorbed into eq_lo — are **already in this tree**; the doc headers are
byte-identical to the challenge repo's. They are inherited upstream code, not a
Yukon addition, and nothing there needs porting.

## Commit phase, ST: decomposition and the refuted butterfly rewrite (2026-08-25)

Commit-phase breakdown at m=32, single-threaded (`FLOCK_COMMIT_M=32
FLOCK_NTT_SPLIT=1 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`, bench `pcs_commit`):
alloc/pad ~90 ms (prefault-hidden in the real prover), **NTT 858 ms** (top 9
fused-2 layers 329 ms, deep 11 blocked layers 529 ms), **merkle 417 ms** —
merkle is at the SHA-256 silicon floor (~2.6 GB/s) and closed.

**Refuted experiment — "q-resident 3-PMULL karatsuba butterflies"** (reverted,
this commit). The premise was a misdiagnosis: `butterfly_row_pair` /
`butterfly_fused_2layer` have no aarch64 dispatch arm, so I read the portable
fallback as "scalar, 6 PMULLs through the struct/GPR interface". Wrong — the
portable butterfly is generic over `F128` ops, and `F128::mul` on aarch64
inlines `ghash_mul_binius` (gf2_128.rs:104-115, where the comment records that
M-series picked binius over karatsuba). The baseline was already running the
M1-tuned mul, register-resident after inlining.

Measured, same session, same machine state, m=32 ST:

| arm | top 9 | deep 11 | NTT total |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (binius via generic path) | 328.6 ms | 529.5 ms | 858 ms |
| karatsuba + q-resident kernels, GPR half-sums | 540 ms | 873 ms | 1410 ms |
| same, half-sums moved to NEON (veor+vext) | 525 ms | 835 ms | 1360 ms |

+58% regression, reproduced across two runs pre-fix and confirmed post-fix;
the GPR-vs-NEON sum was worth only ~4 points of the 58. Fewer PMULLs lost to
binius's shape: karatsuba's mid-term chain plus a per-butterfly vzip/reduce/
vunzip repack costs more than the three PMULLs it saves. This is the sixth
confirmation that re-encoding fixed work never pays on this machine (0/6), and
it extends the rule to PMULL count itself: **binius's 6-PMULL mul beats
3-PMULL karatsuba in situ on M1, not just in the latency microbench**.

Kept from the episode: the `FLOCK_COMMIT_M` bench knob and the temporary
`FLOCK_NTT_SPLIT` probe (strip the probe when the commit campaign closes).
Remaining commit-ST headroom candidates, unmeasured: aarch64 fused-4 for the
top layers (`fused4_ok` is currently x86-only; top layers are full-buffer
sweeps, so deeper fusion removes memory passes — the win category with the
best track record), and nothing else obvious; cross-tree, our commit was
already at parity or ahead.

## Cross-tree commit is measured parity, not inferred (2026-08-25)

The earlier claims ("our commit is 1.4x faster", later corrected, then
"parity or ahead") all came from in-prover bucket timers, which are
confounded: their `commit_s` wraps a `rayon::join` that includes their
round-1 AB precompute. Today: direct primitive-level A/B, m=31 packed
breakdown, ST, alternating arms, 3 pairs, same minute, both trees' own
`pcs_commit` bench (byte-identical bench code; theirs got the same
FLOCK_COMMIT_M knob temporarily and was restored after; both merkle
defaults are SHA-256; FLOCK_NO_GPU_COMMIT=1 on their arm):

| arm | NTT (3 runs) | merkle | total |
|---|---|---|---|
| ours | 418 / 421 / 419 ms | 212.8 / 212.6 / 212.4 | 692 / 692 / 690 |
| theirs (c576e68) | 422 / 437 / 420 ms | 212.2 / 213.8 / 212.2 | 690 / 706 / 684 |

Identical to within ~1% on every bucket. Their NTT source files DO differ
from ours (5 files), so this is a measured null, not shared code: whatever
they changed there is performance-neutral at this shape, and there is no
commit-phase port pool. Caveats: run on battery power with an active Zoom
call (a real >15% gap could not hide in data this tight, but treat the
third decimal as weather); and their tree has a Metal `gpu_commit.rs` path
we did not exercise — CPU-vs-CPU is parity, GPU-on is untested and out of
scope for this campaign.

## Open campaign, ST (2026-08-25): the combine port, and a full two-tree reconciliation

Protocol parity first: both trees produce byte-identical proofs at n=65536
BLAKE3 (395,919 bytes) with identical verify times, so open comparisons are
clean. ST decomposition (PCS_TRACE + LIG_PROVE_TRACE / their
FLOCK_OPEN_TIMING, same day, same machine):

| sub-phase | ours (pre) | theirs | ours (post-port) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| combine (b_combined fold+prime) | 94.4 | 64.4 | **78.5–79.4** |
| initial sumcheck | ~36 | 44.6 | ~36 |
| recursive commits (NTT+merkle) | 19.0 | 14.9 | 19.0 |
| induce_sumcheck_poly | 7.5 | 5.6 | 7.5 |
| ring_switch / folds / glue / OOD | ~3.7 | ~3.7 | ~3.7 |
| **open TOTAL** | **~160** | **132.7** | **~145** |

**The port (commit 6baccea): composed-table fold.** `fold_one_slot(·, T)` is
F₂-linear, so `lo ↦ fold_one_slot(lo·e_hi, T)` collapses into one composed
byte table per claim per block (x-ladder monomial walk + subset-sum
doubling), deleting the per-slot field multiply — 2·L muls — from the sweep.
Needs the coarse deferred split (eq_lo 2^15, not the balanced 2^11) so the
~4.3k-op build amortizes. Bit-identical (equivalence test + verify). Their
tree had both pieces; they never A/B'd it as a unit — it predates their
session. Prediction was −30 ms; measured −15 ms, and the sub-timer probe
explains the rest (below). MT: combine 10.9 ms at 8T (near-linear transfer).

**Corrected accounting (in-fold sub-timers + open_combine_probe micro).**
Sweeps alone: ours compose 1.2 + sweep0 22.7 + sweep1 24.5 = 48.4 ms —
EXACTLY their sweep cost (64.4 bucket − ~16 prime). The remaining bucket
difference is the tail pass: our fused prime+round-1-lookahead costs 24.5 ms
vs their plain prime ~16 ms, and the lookahead buys ~12 ms back in initial
sumcheck (36 vs 44.6). Tail+initial: ours 60.5, theirs 60.6 — **the
lookahead placement is a wash**, another instance of "moving fixed work
between buckets is not a speedup." It stays only because it is inherited
code (zero new lines to keep). Earlier probes that "showed lookahead free"
were wrong: LIG_LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE only gates the ligerito consumer, never
the combine's producer pass.

**Nulls, measured.** (1) EOR3 depth-3 fold tree: flat (79.5 vs 79.1) — LLVM
already fuses XOR pairs into EOR3 under target-cpu=native, and the sweep is
load-port bound (32 loads/slot). Not kept. (2) Fusing both claims into one
sweep (two live 64 KiB composed tables, single store, no RMW read-back):
55.6 vs 48.4 ms in the micro — the doubled gather footprint thrashes L1.
Validates the claim-sequential design note in the challenge tree.

**Residual vs theirs, and why it is closed for now**: ~6 ms structural
(recursive commits 19 vs 15, induce 7.5 vs 5.6) comes from their
sparse/windowed transpose-NTT + truncated-final-NTT machinery — thousands
of lines whose four kill-switches all measured null at this shape in their
own tree (peer-session test; several gate on their ranked 2^18 shape and
cannot fire here). Fails the bloat bar decisively at ~6 ms. The remaining
~7 ms is unattributed noise; Fiat-Shamir grinding lives inside "initial
sumcheck" and swings 1.8–8.4 ms per sample (their measurement, same bucket
convention in both trees).

Instrumentation kept (strip at campaign close): `open_combine_probe` bench +
`pcs::combine_probe` module, and the `b=` field in the combine trace line.
Conditions caveat: battery power + active Zoom all afternoon; every kept
number is an internal same-run comparison or reproduced across ≥3 samples.

**Addendum (peer measurement, same day): their truncated-final-NTT is a real
null even at its designed shape.** At the ranked 2^18 config (the exact shape
`is_ranked_induce_truncated_final_ntt_shape` pins: log_msg_cols=19,
n_queries=218), 7 paired ST samples with the production switch
`FLOCK_NO_LIG_INDUCE_TRUNCATED_NTT`: lig-prove 132.39 ms ON vs 132.79 OFF,
induce 12.23 vs 11.80 — flat. So the truncation contributes nothing anywhere;
whatever induce/commit edge their tree holds (~6 ms at our shape) rides on
the always-on sparse transpose-NTT, not this. The not-ported decision stands
with their own numbers behind it. Their run also showed the familiar
environmental spike (two trailing samples at ~2× on BOTH arms identically) —
same all-week pattern, comparison-safe, logged for the record.

## Witness gen, ST: streamed full-write builder (2026-08-25, kept)

Focused bench (`genwitness_phase`, n=65536, m=30): ours 95.9 ms best /
123 avg; their default 61.4/62.4; their scalar path (FLOCK_NO_WITGEN_SIMD=1)
73.8/76.1. So their edge decomposed as: streamed full-write + unrolled Gs
(−22 ms) then SIMD quad lockstep (−12 ms more).

Ported the first, natively: three `PackedWordWriter`s publish complete u64s
sequentially (rows are contiguous through USEFUL_BITS), killing BOTH the
driver's per-group memset and the OR path's read-modify-write on every
store; the 56-G sequence unrolls with literal state/message indices. The
one out-of-order region (out_lo, 256-bit aligned) is reserved and
overwritten at the end. Bit-identical through the whole driver (new test:
real + padding slots, both values of the prefix carry bit).

Paired alternating A/B, best-of-12 per invocation: **ST 87.1–90.0 →
64.8–68.9 ms (−24%, 3/3 disjoint ranges); 8T 18.0–18.3 → 14.4–15.8 ms
(−20%, 2/2)**. Avg variance also fell (113 → 88 ms ST). In-prove witness
bucket: 89.5 → 67.3 ms. Our streamed scalar now BEATS their scalar (73.8);
their remaining SIMD-quad edge is ~3–7 ms ST for ~400+ lines of NEON
lockstep + NT-drain + scratch-provenance machinery — fails the bloat bar.

## Re-baseline: full ST cross-tree table after the open + witness ports

Same day, same machine, GPU off on their arm (their Aug 22 binary),
n=65536: ours witness 67.3 / commit 300.8 / zerocheck 396.9 / lincheck
56.4 / open 146.7 / **total 967.4 ms (67.7k comp/s)**; theirs 30.4 /
424.8 / 217.3 / 42.2 / 132.7 / **total 847.1 ms (77.4k comp/s)**. Headline
gap **1.46× (start of day) → 1.14×**. Two buckets remain confounded, both
in their favor's appearance only: their commit carries their round-1 AB
prep (known since the zerocheck campaign) — commit+zerocheck combined is
697.7 vs 642.1 (1.09×, matching the ~10% kernel-quality verdict) — and
their in-prove witness bucket (30.4) is HALF their own focused bench
(61.4), so something (seed-pipe speculation or the rate2-codeword fusion)
moves witness work out of that bucket; under investigation. Honest
remaining real gaps: lincheck 1.34×, their witness accounting, ~9% kernel
quality in zerocheck+commit.

## Lincheck: two-stripe word-load fold reaches the load floor (2026-08-25, kept)

The prior "no reachable headroom" verdict on the lincheck fold examined
blocking strategies and table geometry; the challenge tree's newer asm
kernel wins differently: the inner loop is load-port bound, and their
kernel grabs each stripe's 8 index bytes as ONE paired load (UBFX
extracts) while folding two stripes per iteration with EOR3. Ported the
idea as intrinsics (u64 load + shift extraction, two stripes per
iteration, XOR pairs LLVM fuses to EOR3): 16 loads/stripe -> ~9,
bit-identical XOR multiset. Paired A/B: **partial_fold_z ST 40.7-40.8 ->
27.8-28.0 ms (-32%, 3/3 disjoint, at the ~28 ms computed floor); 8T
6.0-6.1 -> 4.3-4.4 ms (-28%)**. Lincheck bucket 56.4 -> 42.6 ST — parity
with theirs (42.2). One measurement-hygiene note for the record: two
paired runs were invalidated before the real one — a stale-binary
overwrite refusal (aliased interactive cp) and a stash left behind by a
failed && chain built both arms from the same source; both caught by the
disjoint-range check and a binary cmp before trusting any numbers.

## End-of-day cumulative (n=65536, m=30): 1.46x -> ~1.10x

ST: witness 71.6 / commit 300.7 / zerocheck 379.7 / lincheck 42.6 /
open 144.6 — **936 ms, 70.0k comp/s**. 8T: 152.9 ms, **428.7k comp/s**.
Vs their same-day CPU-only 847 ms ST: 1.10x, with their commit+zerocheck
bucket confounds unwound this is within the ~9% uniform-kernel-quality
band established by the SHA-256 control. Today's three kept ports:
composed-table open fold (-15 ms), streamed witness builder (-22 ms),
two-stripe lincheck fold (-13 ms) — ~50 ms ST total, all bit-identical,
all paired-decisive, all transferring to 8T.

## Round 1, final pass: the "bigish gap" was mostly an estimation error (2026-08-25)

Skip-arm probes (FLOCK_R1_SKIP_PREP / _DRAIN, since stripped; the stripe-fold
timer under FLOCK_ZC_TIMING was kept) split our round 1 at m=30 ST:
**AB prep 160 + AB drain 39 + stripe fold 28 ≈ 230 ms** — the stripe fold
already carries today's two-stripe lincheck kernel (was ~41).

The peer session then measured their prep arm directly (their
FLOCK_PHASE_TIMING probe inside the commit rayon::join, 7 ST samples,
GPU off): **~140 ms**, not the ~105–125 my commit-bucket subtraction
estimated. Corrected comparison:

| piece | ours | theirs |
|---|---:|---:|
| AB prep | 160 | ~140 (measured) |
| drain + fold | 67 | 72.5 |
| **round 1 total** | **~230** | **~213** |

So round 1 is ~7% apart, we are AHEAD on drain+fold, and the prep delta is
12.5%, not 40%. Their prep mechanism (their read): `fused_apply_one_k_fast`
— identical gather structure, but unreduced PMULL/Horner accumulation with
one fused BCAX reduction per step instead of a full reduced GF(2^8)
multiply per K-row. Arithmetic-only; our multiply tail is ~17 ms of the
160 (gathers ~90%), so the port ceiling is ~8–15 ms for ~100 lines of
kernel restructure — below the bloat bar. Their other two prep levers
(DIRECT_AB_ROWS zero-copy views, AB_COMPACT_STORE) address the
materialize-then-read-back architecture ours doesn't have: our prep is
fused into the drain and never writes the 128 MB buffer at all.

**Round-1 verdict, this time with both sides measured: closed.** The
remaining zerocheck delta decomposes as r1 arithmetic ~8–15 (priced, not
taken), r2 compact format ~7–10 (priced, not taken), tail parity.

## Official end-state grid: clean-conditions, no-timer, both trees (2026-08-25 night)

Machine quieted to just the two Claude sessions, AC power, 100% charged.
15 runs: 3 per config, interleaved between trees, bare `blake3_proof`
n=65536 (no instrumentation env), best-of-3 proves per run. Ours at HEAD;
theirs the Aug 22 binary at c576e68.

| config | ours (best, spread) | theirs (best, spread) | gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| ST CPU | 930.4 ms / 70.4k c/s (0.3%) | 843.7 ms / 77.7k c/s (0.9%) | 1.10x |
| 8T CPU | 156.1 ms / 419.8k c/s (0.4%) | 131.3 ms / 499.3k c/s (2.0%) | 1.19x |
| 8T GPU-on | — (no GPU path) | 131.0 ms / 500.3k c/s (2.3%) | 1.19x |

Findings: (1) no-timer headlines match the instrumented runs within noise —
instrumentation overhead confirmed ~zero, all bucket analyses stand;
(2) run spread at 0.3–0.9 % ST confirms every prior "day-mode"/spike
anomaly was ambient load, not code; (3) their GPU is worth nothing at 8T
(131.0 vs 131.3) — their CPU path caught up to their own Metal offload;
(4) the MT gap is 1.19x under clean conditions (1.23x on battery), and it
is scheduling (helper threads / epool P+E / allocator recycling), not
kernels — ST stands at 1.10x with every bucket at parity or priced.

## Their GPU, resolved: an ST-only, ranked-shape-only effect (2026-08-25 night)

The clean grid showed GPU-on worth ~nothing at n=65536, contradicting the
campaign-era "+10.7% ST" table. Both were right — different cells. Full
GPU value map (their Aug 22 binary, clean machine, AC, paired same-minute):

| shape / threads | GPU-on | GPU-off | GPU worth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| m=30 ST | 832 ms | 847 ms | +1.7% |
| m=30 8T | 131.0 ms | 131.3 ms | 0 |
| m=32 ST | 2.63 s | 2.87 s | **+9.2%** |
| m=32 8T | 413.5 ms | 406.1 ms | −1.8% |

Mechanism: their heavy offloads are shape-pinned to the ranked m=32
geometry (dormant at m=30 — Metal initializes but the cpu= telemetry shows
all threads busy doing the work), and the GPU only adds value when the CPU
is starved (ST). At 8T the CPU saturates the same memory system, the GPU
graph "finishes with 0.00 ms host wait" (their comment), and sync overhead
turns it slightly negative. In the threaded production configuration the
GPU is worth nothing on either shape; the +10.7% campaign figure was the
m=32 ST cell (reproduced tonight at +9.2%), not a general advantage.

## CORRECTION + the ranked-config picture: the GPU verdict was a config artifact (2026-08-25 late)

**Retraction.** The "their GPU is worth nothing threaded" section above was
measured with the SHA-256 merkle default — which silently fails their
ranked GPU gates (`merkle_hash == Blake3` is a hard condition on the big
offload paths). The user's suspicion that "a flag needed to be turned on"
was correct: with FLOCK_MERKLE_HASH=blake3 at m=32, their GPU is worth
**+35%** at 8T on this M1 Max. The +9.2% ST figure earlier is also
understated for the same reason.

Ranked-config grid (m=32, this machine, clean, same half-hour):

| m=32 8T | ours | theirs |
|---|---:|---:|
| SHA merkle, CPU | 433.6k c/s | 645.6k c/s |
| Blake3 merkle, CPU | 410.3k (no fast blake3-merkle kernel here) | 663.4k |
| Blake3 merkle, GPU 8T | — | 897.9k |
| Blake3 merkle, GPU 10T | — | **942.7k** |

Consequences:
1. The MT gap is SHAPE-DEPENDENT: 1.19x at m=30 but **1.49x at m=32
   CPU-vs-CPU** — their scheduling stack (seed-pipe, epool, allocator
   recycling, AB-prep overlap) is gated on the ranked m=32 geometry and
   never fired in the m=30 comparisons. Their throughput scales +29%
   from m=30 to m=32; ours +3%.
2. Full scored-config gap on this machine: 433.6k vs 942.7k = **2.17x**
   (their reported 600k/900k reproduced here as 663k CPU / 898-943k GPU).
3. The ST kernel campaign remains validly closed (1.10x, same-hash,
   same-shape); what it never measured is the ranked-config stack:
   MT scheduling at m=32, GPU offload behind the Blake3 gate, 10-thread
   epool, and a fast BLAKE3 merkle kernel. Those are the remaining
   campaign, in descending order of measured value.

**10-thread addendum (2026-08-25 late).** All-core (8P+2E) CPU-only runs:
ours m=30 414.3k (−1.3% vs 8T) / m=32 443.1k (+2.2%); theirs m=30 502.1k
(+0.6%) / m=32 595.3k (−7.8% vs their 8T). E-cores are ~worthless for
CPU-only proving on both trees — their 10T mode only pays with the GPU
overlap (943k). Best-CPU-vs-best-CPU at the ranked shape: 443.1k vs
645.6k = **1.46×**, all scheduling, not thread count. Ours reproduced to
5 digits across runs (414,339 vs 414,337 c/s).

## BLAKE3 merkle: the neon8 idea in 290 intrinsics lines (2026-08-25, kept)

Their blake3 merkle edge is a 2.6k-line generated-asm 8-wide kernel; the
mechanism is just ILP (the crate's 4-wide NEON state is latency-bound on
the G chain). Re-derived as intrinsics: two transposed 4-wide states
interleaved G-for-G, dispatched from blake3_hash_many for groups of 8,
crate path for tails, bit-identical by equivalence test.

merkle_tree ST: blake3 1.63→2.30 GB/s at 512 B leaves (+41%, now 1.08×
faster than SHA-256), 1.71→2.42 GB/s at the ranked 1 KB leaves (+42%,
parity with SHA silicon; their asm ≈2.58, i.e. within 6% for 9× fewer
lines). E2E ranked config m=32 8T blake3-merkle: 410.3k → 431.5k c/s —
the −5% blake3 penalty is erased and the ranked hash choice is now free
for this tree. LLVM handled the 32-register pressure without measurable
spill cost; the asm fallback (their .S) was not needed.

## MT campaign, night 1 (2026-08-26): one keeper, seven nulls, a map of what's left

Target (user directive): CPU-only MT within 10% of the challenge tree,
no GPU. Start: 1.19× at m=30 8T.

**Kept — AB hoist v2 (commit d963445):** prep under the commit via
rayon::join, with the two defects that nulled v1 fixed: the ab_pre buffer
comes from the scratch pool uninitialized (fresh vec![0u8] zero+fault cost
was eating the entire gain) and the join window runs on the all-core (P+E)
pool while the rest of the prove stays on P-cores. The E-cores are the
active ingredient: prep is gather/PMULL compute they can add without
stealing the DRAM bandwidth the NTT saturates. Paired 3/3 at m=30
(149.6–151.3 vs 152.5–156.3), 2/2 at m=32 (best clean pair −57 ms).
Best production number: 149.6 ms / 438.1k c/s.

**Nulls/inversions, all paired, all on this M1 Max:** P-pool-only join
(wash, third confirmation); NT stores in witness writers (~0 — M1 ignores
the stnp hint, third confirmation of the model); lincheck-stripe transpose
on E during commit (NEGATIVE: bandwidth task in a bandwidth-bound window,
commit +7 ms); FLOCK_ALLCORE combine (0); NTT fused-4 on aarch64 (+19–26%,
16 live F128s spill — the old code comment was right); two-block scalar
witgen interleave (+40% ST, GPR blowout); quad-lite SIMD witgen (state
math 4-wide, scalar packing — null even after removing 4.5k lane
extractions: the packing is the cost, not the G math).

**Decisive ablations on their tree (same day):** their witgen SIMD is
worth 2× IN-PROVE (24.9→12.1 at 8T) but their SIMD-without-elision
(16.7) ≈ our streamed scalar (16.2) — i.e. the entire remaining witness
gap is their scratch-provenance CONSTANT-REGION ELISION (−4.6 ms their
tree; ceiling probe on ours: −4.8 ms paired, degraded-machine caveat).
The focused genwitness bench measures only their scalar path (the SIMD
gate lives in their prove method), which earlier mislead this log.

Standing at checkpoint: ~1.15× at m=30 (149.6–152.4 vs 130.5–130.9
same-minute). Queued with measured ceilings: witgen constant-region
elision via pool provenance tags (−3..5 ms, ~120 lines), zerocheck
round-2 compact format (−2 ms, ~150 lines, previously priced). Those two
land ≈1.10–1.12×; anything past that is their 2.6k-line lane-wise
vectorized packing. Measurements paused: machine degraded after ~6 h of
continuous benching (witness bench 14.3→37.9 ms both arms) — resume
after cooldown per the discipline.

## MT campaign, morning session (2026-08-26): elision kept; the last 4–6 ms priced

Post-cooldown conditions verified (witness bench back to 14.2 ms from the
degraded 37.9). **Kept — witness constant-region elision (4dc8742):**
scratch-pool provenance tags, derived independently at give (from BlockR1cs)
and take (from the encoder constants), gate skipping b's MAX prefix /
reserved words and all three zero tails on a hit; any other custody clears
the tag. Paired kill-switch A/B, production config: 4/5, mean −2.5 ms,
best 146.98 ms / 445.9k c/s. Byte-identity test drives a tagged give/take
cycle vs a fresh run. (The −4.8 ms ceiling probe from last night was
degraded-machine-inflated; −2.5 is the clean value, in line with their
−4.6 on the larger constant share their layout elides.)

**Final standing, same-minute paired:** m=30 production 149.3–150.6 vs
their 130.2–130.9 = **1.146×** (campaign start 1.19×; best single run
146.98). m=32: ours 572.6 (457.8k, +5.6% on the shape since yesterday) vs
theirs 394.9 = 1.45× — the ranked-shape residual is their m=32-gated
machinery.

**The remaining ~4–6 ms at m=30, priced:** (1) compact round-2
anchor+delta (−1.8 ms @MT measured from their r2 8.9 vs ours 10.7) — ~800
lines in their tree, resurfaces through our three tuned r2/r3 kernels,
worst lines-per-ms of the campaign; their newer symbolic lookahead+cascade
(rounds 3+4 and 5+6 collapsed into earlier passes) sits on top of it,
m=32-gated there, several hundred more lines. (2) Their generated
lane-wise vectorized packing network (−2–3 ms; our quad-lite probe
confirmed the packing, not the hash math, is the cost — vectorizing it is
their 2.6k-line codegen). Both exceed the standing bloat bar; parked for
an explicit call rather than taken unilaterally.

## The m=32 shape, decomposed and probed (2026-08-26)

First m=32 bucket decomposition, both trees (8T-class, same minute):
ours witness 71.2 / commit 260.3 / zc 131.2 / lincheck 27.9 / open 93.6
(sum 584, best total 572.6); theirs 19.2 / 271.6 / 142.4 / 15.9 / 84.9
(sum 534, best total **394.9** — 139 ms of phase OVERLAP that exists only
at m=32, where their ranked stack's gates open). Notably our commit AND
zerocheck buckets are BETTER than theirs at m=32 — the kernel campaign
transferred; the 1.45× lives in witness (−52: their m==32-gated deferred
stripe + witgen hetero drains), lincheck (−12: their round-1 stripe-fold
reuse), open (−9), and the wholesale pipeline overlap.

**Probed and rejected:** deferring our lincheck stripe into the commit's
all-core join window as a third arm, gated to n_blocks_log ≥ 17 —
NEGATIVE 3/3 at m=32 (628.9–641.6 on vs 616.4–633.8 off). Their own
m==32 gate on the same idea works only inside their epool/GPU-window
architecture; re-streaming 512 MB from DRAM into our already-saturated
join window loses to the L1-fused eager transpose both at m=30 (measured
earlier) and m=32. Reverted.

m=32 conclusion: closing it means porting the pipeline architecture
(phase-overlap scheduling), not any single mechanism — same class of
decision as the r2 complex and the packing network. Parked with the rest.

**Correction to the m=32 entry above (blake arms).** The 1.45× figure
compared SHA-merkle arms — which silently disables the blake-gated half of
their ranked stack (the deferred stripe requires HashKind::Blake3, and the
witness attribution above is accordingly wrong: that gate was closed in the
SHA runs). With blake arms (their true ranked config, CPU verified via
util telemetry): theirs 920–950k c/s vs our best (SHA) 457.8k —
**~2.1× at the ranked shape**. What the blake gates open, bucket-level:
their lincheck 15.9→7.6 ms, open 84.9→21.9 ms, plus the deferred-stripe
witness path. Their dev-bench blake-CPU (950k) also exceeds their
worker-scored GPU-off number (630.8k), so ranked scoring overhead is
large; cross-methodology caution applies. Conclusion unchanged in kind
but bigger in degree: the m=32 gap is the integrated blake+m32-gated
pipeline architecture, a deliberate port-project, not a mechanism list.

**RETRACTION of the blake-arms correction above.** The 920–1036k "CPU-only"
figures were GPU-contaminated: the challenge tree's GPU merkle paths
(recursive merkle, L1 overlap) are BLAKE3-only — GPU shaders hash blake,
not SHA — and sat outside the kill-switch list used here; and the GPU-
utilization "verification" sampled only the bench's 3-minute setup window,
killing the process before any timed prove ran (worthless both arms). The
tree's owner reproduced with an airtight fresh-build kill: **their true
CPU-only ceiling at m=32+blake(+blake FS, the worker's hardcoded config)
is 638.9k c/s — consistent with their worker-scored GPU-off 630.8k**,
which is the cross-check that settles it. Their GPU at the ranked config
is worth +57% dev-warm / +43% scored.

Corrected m=32 standing: ours 457.8k (SHA; blake costs us ~4%) vs theirs
639k CPU-only = **1.40×** — in line with the original SHA-arms 1.45×, so
the earlier pipeline-architecture analysis stands as written; the "2.1×"
interlude is void. Also noted from the owner: the ranked worker hardcodes
Blake3 for BOTH merkle and Fiat–Shamir (no env); dev-bench defaults are
SHA — worth +3.7% on their tree; our FS hash config at the ranked point
is an open item. Lesson for the log: a kill-switch list is only as
airtight as the tree's owner says it is, and GPU telemetry must bracket
the timed region, not the process.

## Repo default switched to Blake3 (merkle + Fiat–Shamir), 2026-08-26

Matches the ranked worker's hardcoded config (surfaced by the peer session:
BENCHMARK_HASH = Blake3 for both, no env). HashKind::default(),
FsChallenger::new, and all embedded ligerito TOMLs flipped; SHA-256 remains
selectable per component and the cross-hash tests now exercise it as the
non-default arm. Same-binary A/B: blake-vs-sha −1% at m=30, +2.3% at m=32
— neutral-to-positive thanks to the neon8 merkle kernel. All future
default-config numbers are now at the scored hash point; historical log
entries above used SHA defaults unless marked otherwise.

## m=32 blake, CPU-vs-CPU, finally clean (2026-08-26) — and the real root cause

**The contamination mechanism was a shell bug, not a switch-coverage hole:**
`GPUOFF="A=1 B=1 ..."` as a STRING does not word-split in zsh, so
`env $GPUOFF cmd` set one garbage variable and none of the kill switches —
verified by a 1 s GPU trace showing 94–98% utilization through an "all-off"
run. The array form (used by the original official grid) and inline env
lists were always valid; every blake "GPU-off" cell used the string form.
The earlier "blake-gated GPU-merkle paths escaped the kill list" hypothesis
is withdrawn — the switches were simply never delivered. (Same zsh footgun
as the `for arm in $order` loop earlier in this campaign; now twice bitten.)

**Clean paired comparison, m=32, Blake3 merkle+FS (the ranked hash point),
CPU-only both arms, inline envs:**

| pair | ours (default config, prod) | theirs (8T, all kills) | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 592.3 ms / 442.6k c/s | 392.1 ms / 668.6k c/s | 1.51× |
| 2 | 629.0 ms / 416.8k c/s | 413.4 ms / 634.1k c/s | 1.52× |

Their arm agrees with the owner's airtight fresh-build (638.9k) and their
worker-scored GPU-off (630.8k) — three independent methodologies within
5%. **Verified standing at the ranked shape and hash: 1.51× CPU-only.**
(Slightly above the SHA-arms 1.40–1.45× because the blake hash point
benefits their tree ~4% and ours ~2%.) The composition of that gap is the
previously-logged one: their m=32-gated pipeline (phase overlap, deferred
stripe, round-collapsing r2 complex) plus their blake-tuned kernels.

## The "pipeline architecture" was an accounting mirage (2026-08-26)

Stage 1 of the pipeline port (Merkle leaf hashing fused into the NTT deep
pass's sub-group tasks, ~200 lines, bit-identical, kill-switched) measured
3/5 pairs, mean −0.6% at m=32 — a null (the deep pass is PMULL-compute-
bound, so hash compute doesn't ride stalls; only the codeword re-read
saving survives). REVERTED.

The null prompted re-examining the "139 ms of phase overlap" that motivated
the pipeline theory — and it dissolves: their multi-run breakdown
(BLAKE3_BREAKDOWN_RUNS) shows per-run buckets summing to ~471 ms against
~400 ms headline runs, which is exactly their prove_fast_TIMED wrapper
being ~15% slower than the untimed path (documented in week one and
forgotten). Their buckets are self-consistent within the timed path; the
"overlap" was timed-buckets-vs-untimed-best. WITHDRAWN.

**The real m=32 (blake, CPU-only) gap, timed-vs-timed, finally solid:**

| phase | ours | theirs | delta | mechanism |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| witness | 71.2 | 29.5 | −41.7 | their witgen SIMD packing (2× in-prove) + scaling |
| commit(+prep) | 260.3 | 231.0 | −29.3 | window packing/alloc details, NTT+merkle parity |
| zerocheck | 131.2 | 113.6 | −17.6 | their r2 lookahead+cascade (m==32-gated) |
| lincheck | 27.9 | 16.2 | −11.7 | their round-1 stripe-fold reuse |
| open | 93.6 | 79.8 | −13.8 | ranked open machinery |

No scheduling magic — five kernel/structure ports, all previously priced,
with m=32 values now attached. The big mover is the witgen SIMD packing
network: worth only ~2–3 ms at m=30 (why it was declined) but ~40 ms at
m=32. Revised menu, m=32 value per effort: witgen packing (−40, 2.6k-line
class), r2 complex (−18, ~800 lines), lincheck stripe-reuse (−12,
unscoped), open ranked pieces (−14, partially GPU-adjacent), commit misc
(−29, undecomposed). Ceiling if all land: ~600 → ~490 vs their ~400
untimed — the last ~90 is their untimed-path leanness itself.

## The SIMD packing port that became an allocation fix (2026-08-26)

The witgen SIMD packing network — the full lane-wise design: u32-granular
writers whose pending word lives in a vector register, every push one
vsli with compile-time constants, an L1 stage per stream, vld4-deinterleave
contiguous dump — was implemented via a build.rs generator (committed
artifact = the ~200-line generator, not the 2.6k-line unrolled output) and
was bit-identical on the first full test run. It then measured a NULL
in-prove at both shapes, because the real in-prove witness cost was never
the builder: **the lincheck stripe buffer was a fresh zeroed 128–512 MB
allocation every prove**, faulted during the transpose. Pooling that one
buffer (c8d36b6): witness m=30 18.5→8.0 ms, m=32 74→33 ms, both 2/2
decisive — more than the SIMD port's entire predicted value. The quad
kernel was reverted unmerged per the bloat rule; its full design and the
generator live in the commit history via c8d36b6's message.

Their in-prove witness advantage is now INVERTED at m=30 (ours 7.9 vs
their 12.1) and mostly closed at m=32 (ours ~33 vs their timed 29.5).
Third lesson of this genre in the campaign: measure the allocation story
before porting a kernel (elision, ab_pre pooling, and now this).

## Certification grid: MT target met at m=30 (2026-08-26)

Final verification grid, both trees end-to-end untimed-best, blake3
merkle+FS both arms, CPU-only both arms (their five GPU kill switches as a
zsh array, verified by comp/s sanity), 8T, interleaved same-minute pairs
with alternating order. Ours = HEAD (feb41428 build: pool fix c8d36b6,
blake defaults fc78188); theirs = their fresh Aug-26 build (5d405d46).

| pair | ours m=30 | theirs m=30 | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 141.85 | 133.89 | 1.059× |
| 2 | 144.69 | 137.35 | 1.053× |
| 3 | 143.28 | 132.08 | 1.085× |

Best-vs-best **141.85 vs 132.08 = 1.074×**, every pair ≤1.09×: the
"MT within 10% of yukon" target is CERTIFIED at the prod shape
(462.0k vs 496.2k comp/s). Our best buckets: witness 7.6 / commit 64.7 /
zc 33.7 / lincheck 8.1 / open 27.9.

m=32 pairs: 542.22/397.56 = 1.364× and 541.32/405.82 = 1.334×
(483.5k vs 659.4k comp/s best) — matches the priced-menu projection;
the residual is the five parked ports (r2 complex, lincheck stripe-reuse,
open ranked, commit misc, witgen tail).

Conditions: AC power, ambient GUI load (WindowServer ~55%, Texifier ~30%)
— absolute numbers mildly inflated vs quiet-window bests (their m=32 read
384-386 in a quieter window an hour earlier; ratios are interleaved and
robust). Two grid attempts discarded first: one ran a stale pre-pool
binary left newest by the A/B stash build (witness bucket 18/68 ms gave
it away), one was launched under bash where `$ARRAY` expands to its first
element — kill switches silently dropped, their GPU came alive (1.02M
comp/s tell). Both hazards now in the protocol notes.

## Commit-bucket decomposition: the gap was absorption economics (2026-08-26)

FLOCK_COMMIT_TIMING splits our m=32 commit bucket (270ms): replicate-fill
13ms solo, NTT-from-layer-2 124ms, merkle (neon8) 54ms = **191ms of commit
work** — plus the hoisted AB prep (85ms solo) absorbed at nearly full
cost. The join window is thread-THROUGHPUT-bound: both arms scale threads
near-perfectly, so wall = (191+85 work)/(pool) = 276 predicted, 270-278
measured. Sequencing the fill before the join just moved the contention
onto the NTT (124→230 beside prep; fill 90→13): thread-work is conserved,
order can't matter. Paired A/B 3/3 old-schedule (best 558.4 vs 584.8,
noisy window); reverted with numbers in the commit message.

Peer anatomy (clean window, verified): their commit is ONE fused pipelined
pass — replicate+NTT+merkle-LEAVES prints as a single 223-298ms number
(min 223, cluster 223-242) + merkle-parents 0.1ms. Their AB-prep arm
(116.9ms) rides the join FREE because the fused pass is bandwidth-bound
and leaves idle thread-time. Their zc bucket (120.4) contains no prep
(r1 41.3 + r2 49.4 + r3+ 29.7 sums exactly). So: commit work ours 191 vs
theirs 223 — WE are ahead on work; bucket ours 270 vs theirs ~231 —
they win on absorption. The earlier "-29 commit misc" menu item is
re-attributed: it is join-contention, not kernel deficit.

Consequence: the m=32 commit lever is DELETING THREAD-WORK from the join
window, not scheduling. Two candidates: (1) fuse the replicate-fill into
the first computed NTT layer-block (read z directly per replica; deletes
the 2GB fill write + its re-read, ~25-30ms thread-work); (2) retry
NTT→merkle-leaf fusion — measured null SOLO earlier (deep pass
compute-bound) but under a thread-bound join, thread-work cuts pay even
when solo wall doesn't. Together ≈ bucket parity with their 223-231.

Our zc r1/r2/r3+ split at m=32: attempted, contaminated (user interactive
on the machine; mins r1 38.7 / r2 70.1 / r3+ 64.7 exceed the known-clean
134ms zc total — upper bounds only). Redo in a quiet window; their
r2 49.4 vs our clean r2 (TBD) prices the r2-complex port properly.

## Fill→NTT fusion: NULL, reverted (2026-08-26)

Implemented `forward_transform_interleaved_from_message`: the first fused-2
top pass copies its four input rows straight from z into the codeword rows
and butterflies them in place L1-hot, deleting the standalone 2GB
replicate pass (bit-identical: garbage-start equivalence test over 5
shapes, NTT oracle, prove/verify roundtrips ×3 circuits; kill switch
FLOCK_NO_FILL_FUSE=1). Paired same-binary A/B, 8 pairs at m=32 (ambient
noisy, user interactive): commit-bucket sign test 6-2 AGAINST fusion,
totals 4-4, min-vs-min commit 308.3 fuse vs 297.9 nofuse. Reverted;
diff preserved at scratchpad/fillfuse.patch (566 lines) and in this entry.

MODEL REFINEMENT (the valuable part): the fill's 90ms under the join was
QUEUEING, not work — a memcpy pass contributes few thread-ms, so deleting
its DRAM traffic doesn't shorten a thread-bound critical path, and the
per-row copies added overhead inside the butterfly tasks. The commit
bucket is compute-limited: NTT ~124 + merkle ~54 + prep ~85 ≈ 263 of
thread-work ≈ the measured 270-278 wall. Corollary: the planned
NTT→merkle-leaf fusion retry is ALSO downgraded — it deletes a 2GB READ
(bandwidth, not thread-work) and keeps all the hashing compute; the
earlier solo null likely stands under the join too.

Surviving m=32 commit levers, by the compute model: make PREP cheaper
(unreduced-PMULL Horner arithmetic, priced ~100 lines at m=30 and
declined at ~8-15ms; prep is 85ms at m=32 so the same idea re-prices to
an est. −20-30 bucket) — everything else in the window is already at its
measured floor (fused-4 top NEON: tried, register spill, +19-26%).

## RETRACTION: the "prep Horner" menu item was already banked (2026-08-26)

Before implementing the recommended unreduced-PMULL Horner port, archaeology
killed it: the headline win behind that name is ALREADY MERGED as e1398be
(Aug 24, "accumulate round-1 prep products unreduced (pmull + weight
split)") — the −128 ms / 8-of-8 ST result, §pmull of the writeup, one of
the seven kept changes. What the menu item actually referred to was the
RESIDUAL after that merge, priced at round-1 closure (74802fc): ~8-15 ms
ceiling at m=30 ST for ~100 lines through the hottest kernel — declined
then, and the decline stands.

Decisive at today's target shape: at m=32 8T under the join, OUR prep arm
measures 85-101 ms vs THEIR prep arm's 116.9 (their own clean sample).
Our prep is already faster than theirs in the current architecture; there
is nothing left in their tree's prep worth porting. My "−20-30 ms"
estimate from earlier today was an error — I re-priced the menu label
without checking that the mechanism behind it was already in.

Corrected m=32 menu (nothing cheap left in commit): zc r2 anchor+delta
complex (−15..30, ~800 lines), open ranked pieces (−10..20), lincheck
stripe-fold reuse (−5, unscoped). The commit bucket's remaining −40 vs
theirs is absorption economics (their bandwidth-bound fused pass hides
prep free); by the compute-limited model it has no sub-800-line lever.

### Amendment (same day, prompted by Benedikt)

"Our prep is already faster than theirs" overstated an ARM-WALL comparison
into a kernel claim. Scope is symmetric (both arms = the full
challenge-independent AB transform; the challenge-dependent drain is
outside both, pinned by Fiat-Shamir), but the contexts aren't: their 116.9
runs beside a bandwidth-bound pass (near-solo), our 85-101 beside
compute-saturating passes (contended). Scaling the clean ST closure
numbers (160 vs 140 at m=30, post-e1398be) to m=32 8T: theirs ~80 solo vs
ours ~91 — their prep kernel is likely still ~12% cheaper in isolation.
The port stays dead for the corrected reason: the reachable ~10-11 ms has
no named mechanism left (unreduced accumulation, zero-copy rows, and
dead-row-fill skip are all banked here; their BCAX fold vs our
shift+x2-byte absorb is a few vector ops in a gather-dominated kernel) —
it's the campaign's unattributed uniform-kernel-quality band.

## 8-P-core pool pinning retested at m=32: still correct (2026-08-26)

Benedikt asked whether the deliberate 8-thread (P-core) global pool is now
a slowdown at the ranked shape. Paired A/B, default-8 vs
RAYON_NUM_THREADS=10, 3 pairs m=32 (noisy window): sign 2-1 for t8,
cleanest pair dead even (574.2 vs 576.1). Per-phase on the clean samples:
zc +14 ms and lincheck +6 ms on 10T (E-core stragglers at barriers),
witness/open unchanged. The early-campaign "8 beats 10 on NTT-shaped
phases" verdict holds with today's kernels. E-cores remain harvested
selectively (join window, NTT deep pass, open combine — the phases where
they add compute to bandwidth-bound windows) and nowhere else. Pool
pinning is NOT part of the m=32 residual.

### Epool priced by the peer's own kill-switch A/B: below bar (2026-08-26)

The peer added FLOCK_NO_EPOOL to their tree (it didn't exist; I'd assumed
it from naming) and ran 3 alternating pairs at ranked CPU config: epool
is worth ~6.6% / ~26.5ms total THERE, 3/3 clean — but decomposed:
commit −10.7 (their AB-prep-hetero, the analog of the all-core join we
ALREADY have), zc −6.7, lincheck −0.6, open +3.1 (reversed, ~noise).
Portable NEW value for us = zc+lincheck ≈ −7ms for a queue primitive +
call-site conversions (~200 lines): below the bloat bar and priced-and-
parked (zc-only variant listed on the menu at −6..7). The "uniform
kernel-quality band" is NOT hidden E-core scheduling; the m=32 menu
stands: r2 complex (−15..30, ~800 lines), open ranked (−10..20),
lincheck stripe-reuse (−5), epool-zc (−6..7, ~200 lines).

### epool: NULL-TO-NEGATIVE on our kernels, reverted (2026-08-26)

Paired kill-switch A/B, 3 pairs m=32: tail 3/3 WORSE with helpers
(49.7-51.4 off vs 53.6-56.2 on), zc bucket 3/3 worse (131-149 off vs
142-171 on), r2 2/3 worse (42.2-47.4 off vs 45.3-46.7 on). Reverted (the
implementation survives in history, commit "zerocheck: bounded-tail
E-core chunk queue"). Mechanism: our r2/tail are bandwidth-heavy
streaming passes; background-QoS E-cores add DRAM pressure the P-cores
need — 4th confirmation of the bandwidth-on-bandwidth rule. Their epool
pays on THEIR kernels plausibly because anchor+delta/compact formats
made those passes compute-relative. RETEST epool after the anchor+delta
port lands.

Also learned from the off arm: our incumbent r2 is 42-47ms at m=32 —
already FASTER than their timed 49.4 (≈ parity with their scored ~43).
The r2-side of the anchor+delta port is ≈0; the port's value is
concentrated in the TAIL (ours ~50 vs their timed 29.7): the r3
table-combine, lookahead, and cascades. Task #3 rescoped accordingly.

## Cascade tail: built, verified, staged opt-in — coupled to anchor+delta (2026-08-26)

Three A/B rounds at m=32 told the full story:
1. Scalar lookahead passes (as the AG tail ships them): tail 57-59 vs
   classic 52-54 — the historical "lookahead = 13-15% regression" verdict
   reproduced, and diagnosed as KERNEL QUALITY (generic scalar F128 muls
   vs the classic path's q-resident NEON kernel), not scheduling.
2. NEON lookahead kernel + fold1 entry: tail 50.4-51.7 vs 50.5-51.4 —
   WASH, explained by pass accounting: the fold1 entry (the largest pass)
   saves no traffic and pays the full product bill.
3. Integrated r2 lookahead (r2 emits the 8 sums; all tail passes 4→1):
   tail 35.0-37.4 vs 49.6-53.1, 3/3 DISJOINT (−15) — but r2 67-80 vs
   42.6-47.8 (+24). The surcharge is the mul-count floor (8 mul_q + 8
   wide per group vs classic's 4+4 = 36 extra PMULL/group × 2^24); a
   two-sweep de-spill restructure changed nothing. Net zc ≈ +9. 

CONCLUSION: cascade and anchor+delta are COUPLED — their tree affords the
surcharge only because their compact r2 pays it from a lower base
(deferred odd-element folds + cheaper unreduced product accumulation).
Staged opt-in (FLOCK_ZC_LOOKAHEAD=1, transcript byte-identical by test);
anchor+delta port is the remaining piece, anatomy question out to the
peer: where do the odd folded values for THEIR Q products come from —
paid delta-gathers in r2, or a product formulation in anchor/delta space?

## Cascade CERTIFIED default-on via one-weight-per-group products (2026-08-26)

The peer read their actual r2 kernel and surfaced the missing formulation:
all eight lookahead products share the group's eq weight → pre-scale the
four a-rows once, every product becomes a single unreduced multiply
(52 vs 72 PMULL/group). Also confirmed from their kernel: anchor+delta is
a STORE-side cut only (their r2 pays the same gathers) — decoupled from
the cascade after all, re-priced as a separate −5..8 item (compact stores
+ r3 byte-table combine).

With w-scaling in both kernels: m=32 tail 33-37 vs classic 53-66 (4/4
disjoint; better than their timed 29.7 after wrapper deflation), r2
surcharge +12 (= its PMULL floor), zc net −8..13 (sign 3/4; −7.7 on the
clean pair). m=30: net −1.0, 2/2, best-of-run sample was a cascade arm
(142.5) — no regression at the certified shape. DEFAULT ON,
FLOCK_NO_ZC_LOOKAHEAD=1 kill switch, transcript byte-identical by test.

Projected m=32 standing: zc 134 → ~121-126 vs their timed 120 — the
zerocheck kernel gap is essentially closed. Remaining m=32 items:
anchor+delta compact stores (−5..8), open ranked (−10..20, parked for
M3/M4 per Benedikt), commit absorption economics (−40, structural).

## m=32 ST gap measured: 1.30x — the MT hypothesis refuted (2026-08-26)

Benedikt asked whether the m=32 gap is multithreading. Both trees ST
(RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1, blake3, CPU-only, same-minute): ours 3.76s vs
theirs 2.89s = 1.30x, vs 1.36x MT (ours 542.1 / theirs 398.3 same
evening, cascade engaged — after fixing ANOTHER stale-bench-binary
incident: the default-on flip was committed without rebuilding the
bench, so the first "quick pull" measured the old default; hazard rule
extended: rebuild the BENCH after every lib change, verify engagement
by a phase signature before comparing). Parallel scaling ours 6.9x vs
theirs 7.3x — MT contributes only ~0.05x. The m=32 deficit is
kernel/path-level, present on one core.

Why m=32 ST is 1.30x when m=30 ST closed at ~1.10-1.15x: their m==32
allowlist — machinery that fires only at this shape (deeper
cascade+anchor+delta forms, ranked-open pieces, SIMD witness packing
whose value concentrates at m=32; our ST witness bucket is 227ms with
no pool overlap to hide the scalar builder). Our ST buckets (cascade
on): witness 227 / commit 1277 / zc 1559 (pre-cascade ~1820) /
lincheck 126 / open 600.

### m=32 ST attribution completed — half the gap is their scored-only path (2026-08-26)

Peer's ST breakdown + our sub-phase split, prep-aligned (their AB prep
sits in their commit at ST — sequential join, a straight +551 tax; ours
sits inline in our zc/r1, ~620): like-instrumented per-phase gaps are
MODEST — witness +22, ntt+merkle +159, r1-sans-prep parity (270 vs ~260,
theirs on their slow r1 path), r2 404 vs ~350, tail 226 vs ~250 (OURS
AHEAD — the cascade), lincheck parity, open +66; our commit-with-prep is
AHEAD of theirs at ST. Sum ≈ +400 of the measured 870ms ST gap. The
other ~470ms: their own bucket sum (3.39s) vs their scored run (2.88s) —
their scored prove_fast is ~18% leaner than their instrumented
prove_fast_timed ("bypasses several ranked-specific warm-path
optimizations", r1 stripe path confirmed as one instance). Ours: ~2%.
THE BIGGEST m=32 ITEM IS NOW ENUMERABLE BY CODE-READ: the diff list
between their prove_fast and prove_fast_timed paths — requested from the
peer. Everything else we have compared is within ~15% per phase.

### Their scored-path enumeration: one real mechanism (= our adjudicated
### fill-fusion), 470ms still unattributed (2026-08-26, late)

Peer's wrapper-diff enumeration: the one substantial scored-only
mechanism is their "from-message commit" (synthesize both codeword
replicas from z during the NTT first layer, deleting a ~1GiB replica
store) — MT-gated (threads>1), and ARCHITECTURALLY IDENTICAL to our
fill-fusion (fillfuse.patch), which measured null-to-negative here:
it pays on their bandwidth-bound commit window, not on our
compute-saturated one. Items 2-6 minor/inapplicable. Their honest
bottom line: the wrapper list does NOT account for the ~470ms
scored-vs-instrumented delta; they are now diffing the timed-vs-untimed
INNER prover fns. Our hypothesis handed over: their timed figure is a
single sample vs scored best-of-3 with warm pools — if the timed inner
fn defeats warm-path buffer reuse, the 18% is allocation economics
(the genre of our two biggest wins). Same 3-untimed+1-timed harness
shape here shows only ~2% skew, so the asymmetry is in their prover fns.

### The 470ms resolved: their instrumentation artifact, nothing to port (2026-08-26, close)

Peer located both mechanisms in their timed path, with line numbers.
(1) A commit-tail-fill hook: their scored path stages round-1's C-fold
prefix in the commit join's idle tail (their commit arm finishes first —
their from-message commit shortened it; the hook fills the window while
their prep arm runs). Their timed core hardcodes the hook to None.
DOESN'T MAP HERE: our join has no idle window — our commit arm is the
long pole and rayon keeps every thread busy (the same thread-bound
economics as the absorption story); at ST it's work-reordering, not
work-deletion. (2) Their scored path's ranked_lincheck_c_reuse (stripe-
based C-derivation, gated to EXACTLY the ranked blake3 shape) — which
our tree runs in ALL paths already (StripeC). Bottom line, their words:
"not something you'd port — it only affects the fairness of MY
diagnostic function against MY real path."

FINAL m=32 ST accounting: the 870ms gap = ~400ms of modest per-phase
deltas (witness +22..53, ntt+merkle +100..160 vs old parity — worth one
re-check, open +66..146, tail OURS ahead) + ~470ms that was their
timed-path artifact inflating every per-phase comparison we made against
their instrumented numbers, of which the real scored-path content is
C-reuse (we have it) and the tail-fill staging (doesn't map). The
cross-tree kernel gap at m=32 is materially smaller than today's bucket
tables suggested; the honest scored-vs-scored per-phase decomposition
would require them instrumenting their scored path, which they may do
for their own tooling honesty.

## FIRST HONEST CROSS-TREE PER-PHASE TABLE (2026-08-26 night)

Their timed prover fixed (tail-fill hook + ranked C-reuse threaded
through; honesty check 0.4% vs scored). Both sides m=32, blake3
merkle+FS, CPU-only. Ours from tonight's clean window (their fresh
3-run averages; our matched re-run was ambient-contaminated — Chrome/
ModelCatalogAgent — so our clean-window singles stand, ±3ms):

| phase    | ours MT | theirs MT | Δ    | ours ST | theirs ST | Δ (prep-aligned) |
|----------|--------:|----------:|-----:|--------:|----------:|-----:|
| witness  |    30.2 |      29.3 |   +1 |     227 |     205.8 |  +21 |
| commit   |   ~274  |     223.6 |  +50 |    1277 |  1673 (incl prep 551) | +155 sans-prep |
| zerocheck|  ~120-128 |    99.9 |  +25 |    1559 (incl prep ~620) | 770.5 | +169 sans-prep |
| lincheck |    19.6 |      16.2 |   +4 |     126 |     117.6 |   +8 |
| open     |    96.5 |      24.9 | +72  |     600 |     122.6 | +477 |
| total    |   ~542  |     393.8 | +148 |    3760 |    2889.8 | +870 |

THE HEADLINE: OPEN is half the gap at both thread counts, and was
mis-priced all campaign by their broken instrumentation (their old timed
open read 79.8-86.6 MT / 534 ST — 3-4x inflated). Their open is FLAT
across m=30→m=32 (~132→~123 ST) while ours scales linearly (145→600):
an algorithmic difference behind their ranked/m==32 gate, not tuning.
Open anatomy requested — loop 1 of the joint phase. After open, the
residuals are commit-sans-prep +155 ST (ntt+merkle — vs the old m=31
parity result, recheck), zc-sans-prep +169 ST, witness +21 ST,
lincheck +8. Their flagged caveat: their MT witness/commit may still be
slightly pessimistic (an MT-only from-message fast path not threaded
through their timed fn).

### Open anatomy received: sufficient-statistic combine (loop 1 target)

Their m==32 open eliminates the O(L) combine sweep outright: b_combined
(size 2^(m-7) — the quantity that 4x's m=30→32) is never allocated at the
ranked shape; ring-switch round-0/1 messages derive from per-claim
FIXED-SIZE sufficient statistics — DirectFold8Factors (64-bank pair),
DirectFold4Factors (16x16 product matrix H[e,d]=Σ_h f[16h+e]·B_k[16h+d]),
DirectFold2Factors (16 products) — none scaling with L. Statistics are
computed where data is already resident (AB from lincheck's z_vec_pre —
cost lands in lincheck; C from zc r1's URM extraction — lands in zc);
we ALREADY have that relocation (our s_hat_v captures skip fold_1b_rows).
What we lack is the elimination itself. CPU-only confirmed (no gpu_commit
refs in their ring_switch). Their isolation switches exist
(FLOCK_NO_OPEN_DIRECT_{FOLD8,FOLD4,AB}) for a confirming measurement.
Port = re-derive the sufficient-statistic construction onto our combine
(our composed-table fold path still does the O(L) sweep). This is the
campaign's largest remaining item: open +72 MT / +477 ST at m=32.

### Loop-1 port plan: sufficient-statistic open (scoped, ready to build)

Inventory: OUR combine (pcs.rs compute_combined_basis_and_target — same
fn lineage as theirs) always materializes b_combined (O(L), composed-
table fold) feeding ligerito::recursive_prover_with_basis, and already
precomputes round0_prime + round1_lookahead in the combine. We have the
128-slice s_hat_v captures (AB from lincheck z_vec_pre, C from zc r1)
but NO banked (retained-coordinate) variant and no factor structs.

Port, three stages, each behind FLOCK_NO_OPEN_DIRECT (default off until
certified), transcript-identical by proof-bytes test at every stage:
1. PRODUCERS: fold8-banked s_hat_v variants of our two captures — keep
   the low 6 suffix coordinates unfolded (64 banks; their bank index =
   little-endian 6-bit retained coordinate matching build_eq(suffix[..6])).
   Their producer refs: ring_switch.rs:3205-3320 (factor assembly from
   w.s_hat_v_fold8), 2545-2558 (struct semantics: A[b,e] = transpose of
   banks, bit-major so pair-fold kernels bind coords in place; W[b,d] =
   Φ(low_eq[d]·x^b); round0 cached at construction).
2. FACTORS + COMBINE BYPASS: when both claims carry factors at the gate
   shape (L == 2^25, two RS claims, no packed-direct), skip b_combined
   entirely (their pcs.rs:1286-1307) and hand the factor pair to the
   recursive prover. γ baked into banks at construction (their
   RingSwitchBatchOutput comment).
3. BANKED SUMCHECK INTAKE: a recursive_prover entry whose rounds 0..6
   run on the A/W factor states (fold banks in place per bind; after six
   binds W collapses to the byte-map generator vector) then rejoin the
   incumbent path. Their consumer ref: ring_switch.rs:4399 (
   "sixty-four-bank intake"), fold4 fallback = 16x16 H[e,d] product
   matrix (H[e,d] = Σ_h f[16h+e]·B_k[16h+d]).
Value: open 96.5→~25 MT (−72), 600→~123 ST (−477) at m=32 if the full
mechanism transfers. Gates: shape-exact like theirs initially, widen
after certification. Estimated size: 400-700 lines, the campaign's
largest port; algebra to re-derive, not copy.

### The algebra (for the port; doc gets it on certification)

Claim k: ⟨f, B_k⟩ = t_k with B_k[i] = γ_k·Π_j eq(u_j, i_j) — RANK-1.
Split i = (e,h) ∈ {0,1}^c × {0,1}^(ℓ−c): B_k = γ_k·lo_k(e)·hi_k(h).
Statistic: G_k[e] = Σ_h f[(e,h)]·hi_k(h) ∈ F^{2^c} — computed free where
f already streams (lincheck z-fold for AB, zc r1 extraction for C; our
s_hat_v captures are the c=0 case). Target t_k = γ_k Σ_e lo_k(e)G_k[e].
Rounds r<c fold G bank-wise (G'[e'] = G[0e'] + ρ(G[1e']+G[0e'])) and
update lo_k's eq factor; messages are the usual quadratics over 2^(c−r)
terms instead of L/2^(r+1). After c binds the surviving bank collapses
into the byte-map generator (their W[b,d] = Φ(low_eq[d]·x^b)); rejoin
incumbent. Deleted: the basis' O(L) life ≈ 4L element-ops + traffic
(alloc + γ-sweep + c rounds of length-L folds). f's own folds remain
(needed downstream). Same field elements throughout ⇒ transcript
bit-identical ⇒ proof-bytes equality is the port's correctness test.
Their fold4 H[e,d] = Σ_h f[16h+e]B_k[16h+d] = the same object with the
basis low factor pre-multiplied. Conceptually: the table-vs-fold rule's
endpoint — one resident rank-1 object ⇒ contract once, never
materialize the map.

### Direct-open derivation, verified against our conventions (implementation basis)

Our ring switch: suffix S = rank-1 eq tensor over word coords (x_outer[1..]);
basis B[i] = φ(S[i]) with φ(u) = Σ_b bit_b(u)·E[b], E = build_eq(r''):
φ is F2-LINEAR (fold_b128_elems). Identities the port rests on:
1. ⟨f,B⟩ = Σ_β x^β·φ(s_hat_v[β])  (F2-linearity pulls φ out of the
   bit_β(f)-weighted sum) — consistent with sumcheck_claim =
   ⟨transpose(s_hat_v), E⟩.
2. BANKED: M_e[β] = Σ_h bit_β(f[(e,h)])·hi(h) (banked s_hat_v, low c word
   coords retained; Σ_e lo(e)·M_e = s_hat_v — the reconstruction test).
   W[b,d] = φ(lo(d)·x^b) (basis-side state; r''-dependent, built at open).
3. Round r<c message at eval point x₀: both states fold at the SAME
   challenges (A on the f-side lag, W on the basis-side lag — same ρ);
   g_r(x₀) = Σ_{e'} Σ_β x^β · Σ_b bit_b(A-partial(x₀,e')[β])·W-partial(x₀,e')[b]
   — O(128·128·2^(c-r)) XOR-dominated, sub-ms; NO O(L) touch.
4. Exit: after all c binds, W's sole bank = the byte-map generator vector
   G[b] = Σ_e lag(ρ)(e)·W[b,e]; b¹[h] = ψ_G(hi(h)) materialized at
   2^(ℓ-c) via the existing composed-byte-table machinery. f folds through
   the same rounds with existing kernels (f-only variant of the lane fold).
Producers are SMALL: AB banks from lincheck's z_vec (2^k_log elements —
banked s_hat_v_from_z_vec, trivial); C banks from the zc capture
analogously. Deleted O(L) work per claim: fold_b128_elems (rs_eq_ind),
the b_combined build, and its c rounds of folds (~4L total).
Implementation order: (1) ring_switch banked structs + reference
producers + W + reconstruction/claim identity tests; (2) round-message +
state-fold fns, oracle-tested vs the dense SumcheckProver at m=13-16;
(3) ligerito lane-fold intake (f-only folds + direct messages + b¹ exit);
(4) pcs gate + banked captures from z_vec/zc; kill switch
FLOCK_NO_OPEN_DIRECT; proof-bytes identity test at every stage.

### Direct open: wired end-to-end, proof-bytes identical (loop-1 units 1-3)

The basis-free opening is complete behind FLOCK_OPEN_DIRECT=1:
prove_batched emits banked claim bundles (RsEqInd::Direct; flat s_hat_v
reconstructed from banks for the transcript), the combine skips
rs_eq_ind + b_combined entirely, and recursive_prover_direct runs the L0
lane folds with f-only array folds + banked round messages, materializes
the residual basis from the exit generators at the level-1 boundary, and
rejoins the incumbent flow. One wiring bug shaken out (banked messages
reached the challenger but not the proof's sumcheck transcript;
prefixed). Also found pre-existing rot in the ignored hand-rolled-config
pcs roundtrip test (fails on HEAD; unrelated).

Verified: proof-bytes identity through the full pcs stack at m=22
(production config shape) + verify; production-glue bundle test; oracle
tests at 4 shapes incl. (15,6); full prove/verify roundtrips on all
three circuits with the direct path ON; 347 core tests green.

REMAINING before the m=32 A/B (unit 4, producers): the v1 gate builds
banks with the serial reference scan — unusable at m=32. Plumb
banked_s_hat_v_from_z_vec (exists, tested) for the AB claim from
prover.rs's z_vec_pre, and generalize the zc r1 s_hat_v_c capture to its
banked form for the C claim. Target: open 96.5→~25 MT / 600→~123 ST.

### Direct open: producers landed, port complete; certification pending
### a clean window (2026-08-26, late night)

Unit 4 (producers) landed: AB banks from lincheck's z_vec_pre
(banked_s_hat_v_from_z_vec, carried through ProveCore), C banks captured
free inside the zc stripe fold (round1_c_banks_from_stripe_with_banked —
same outer partial fold, middle fold stopped c dims early, flat banks
bit-identical by test), plumbed via open_batch_..._banked with per-claim
fallback to the reference scan. Full validation green (proof-bytes
identity, banked-C equivalence, roundtrips with FLOCK_OPEN_DIRECT=1,
348 core tests).

First m=32 A/B attempts hit a heavily contaminated window (bests
836ms-1.3s vs clean 541; Chrome bursts): magnitudes unusable. Signal
that survives: sign 3/3 for direct on usable pairs, and one direct open
sample at 80.8ms — BELOW the clean dense floor (96.5), proving
engagement with real producers and sub-incumbent cost. Certification
A/B (target: open 96.5→~25 MT, 600→~123 ST) deferred to a quiet window;
the gate stays opt-in (FLOCK_OPEN_DIRECT=1) until then.

## DIRECT OPEN CERTIFIED, DEFAULT ON — campaign record (2026-08-26 23:09)

Quiet window (the self-arming gate fired as the machine went idle).
3 MT pairs + 1 ST pair, alternating, kill-switched same binary:

| | direct | dense | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| MT open | 59.5-72.1 | 94.3-100.2 | 3/3 disjoint, −33 avg |
| MT zc | 121.6-126.7 | 127.0-133.0 | no regression (3/3 better) |
| MT best | 484.3-518.4 | 527.4-543.1 | 3/3, avg −32.5 |
| ST open | 210.0 | 614.2 | −404 |
| ST best | 3.37s | 3.74s | −370 |

**Best prove 484.25 ms / 541,336 c/s — the campaign's best m=32 reading.**
Headline vs their scored ~397: ≈1.22×, from 1.36× this morning (the
cascade + direct open together). DEFAULT ON (FLOCK_NO_OPEN_DIRECT=1
kills). The residual open gap (+39 MT / +87 ST vs their honest 24.9/123)
= the unported ranked-open extras (their exact-shape-gated truncated
final NTT + lazy OOD eq) — parked per Benedikt for the M3/M4 revisit,
now cleanly the next item if unparked. Loop-1 of the joint phase is
CLOSED: mechanism identified from their honest numbers, algebra
re-derived, ported in four verified units, certified same-day.

## Open residual, loop 2 opened: our own floor first (2026-08-26, midnight)

Peer's honest ST decomposition of their open (113-126 total): ring-switch
tail 0.5 / combine 0 / initial sumcheck 38-51 / recursive commits ~58 /
induce 11.2 / OOD 0.8. Verdict: their commits are NOT near-zero (parity
with ours per-thread); their edge concentrates in the small stages —
which on OUR side were self-inflicted. Three local fixes, all
transcript-identical (identity test green each step):
1. W-state via fold byte table (was a 128-bit scan/element): tail 8.7→6.6
2. COMPOSED f-fold — unique to the direct path: messages never touch f,
   so all initial_k challenges bind in one 2^k→1 pass (~2L→~1.03L
   traffic): initial sumcheck 26.4→19.6
3. Parallelized bank transposes + reconstruction: tail 6.6→1.4 (their
   floor: 0.5)
OPEN: 64.1 (certified) → 47.6 ms at m=32 8T. Remaining deltas vs their
MT-scaled ~25: initial ~−10 (drill the 19.6), induce −4.5 (their
truncated-final-NTT — exact, requires log_inv_rate==1, fused round-msg
variant), OOD −2.8 (lazy split-eq + glue fused into the next fold),
commits ≈ parity. Their two extras' full anatomy is on file (their
message, ligerito.rs refs).

### Micro-fixes PAIRED-CERTIFIED (correcting the single-sample claim above)

Benedikt asked whether 64.1→47.6 was measured or estimated — it was
single-sample traces across different windows. Proper two-binary paired
A/B (3 pairs, alternating, head rebuilt after): open 45.5-50.4 vs
59.7-61.3 — 3/3 DISJOINT, −12.1 avg (−20%); totals 492.5-511.1 vs
516.0-538.2, 3/3. The honest certified delta for the three micro-fixes
is −12 (not −16.5: the pre-fix arm reads 60.4 in this window, not the
earlier quiet-window 64.1). Best this window: 492.53 ms / 532.2k c/s.

### Initial-sumcheck drill: half is PoW grinding at its floor (2026-08-27)

Fine timers on the direct L0: fold grinds 9.3-11.8ms (block-parallel
lowest-nonce already — protocol security work, high-variance, NOT a
kernel target; explains both trees' initial-sumcheck noise), composed
f-fold 4.5-4.7, b1 5.7-6.4, boundary 0.2-0.6. b1 split-fold variant
tried: SLOWER (9.2-9.4; per-slot mul > saved tensor build at 2^20),
reverted. Grind-adjusted kernel content of our open ≈ 36ms vs their
grind-adjusted ~15-20: remaining targets = induce truncated-final-NTT
(−4.5) and lazy OOD (−2.8), then commits/misc at parity.

### FLOCK_NO_GRIND: grinding removed from the measurement protocol (2026-08-27)

Benedikt: grind time is nonce-search luck (9.3-11.8ms MT of the open at
m=32 L0 alone) and adds variance paired A/B can't cancel. Both trees now
carry the same knob: `FLOCK_NO_GRIND=1` coerces grinding bits to 0 in
`grind_pow` (nonce 0, zero hashing; ~5 lines, LazyLock env check).
Default unchanged (grind ON). Deliberately NOT mirrored in the verifier
— grind-free proofs FAIL verification (the bench's final verify panics
after timings print; scripts tolerate the exit). Yukon confirmed with
Benedikt and added the identical knob. ALL grind-free numbers are a new
baseline family — not comparable to anything certified earlier.

### Port wave 3: truncated-final-NTT induce + lazy OOD (2026-08-27)

Both peer-anatomy items, both transcript-identical (dense-equality unit
tests + full lib suite + m=22 proof-identity green):

1. **Fused low-half final-3 NTT tail** (their `..._fused_final_3layer_
   low_half`): `induce_sumcheck_poly_via_ntt` computed the full 2^21
   transpose then `truncate(n)` — at rate 1/2 the retained half never
   needs the last three layers' full sweeps. Fused strided kernel
   (8-gather, 3 butterfly levels in registers, 4 low writes, in place
   via split_at_mut): last layer's kept output is a plain XOR, ~6n
   traffic → 1.5n. Gated `log_inv_rate == 1` inside the sparse
   transpose. Trace attribution: induce 6.8-7.6 → 6.0-7.2ms MT (~−0.8,
   consistent with the traffic math; peer's −4.5 bundled other diffs).
2. **Lazy OOD** (their `introduce_new_ood_factorized`/`glue_factorized_
   ood` analog): `introduce_ood` splits eq(z,·) = eq_lo ⊗ eq_hi
   (build_eq_table is LSB-first) — round msg + eval read only f, the
   2^n table is never built; glue defers (α·eq_hi, eq_lo) and the next
   basis glue drains all samples fused in its one read-modify-write
   pass (fold paths carry a flush no-op as insurance). Trace: OOD
   samples (5) 2.6-3.0 → 0.4-1.0ms MT; basis glue +0.1-0.6 (the
   drain). Net ≈ −2.

**Wave 3 CERTIFIED** (paired grind-free A/B, quiet-window checked): open
bucket 40.8-41.3 → 36.8-37.8 ms m=32 8T, **−9%, 3/3 disjoint**; totals
2/3 (a ~4ms effect inside ±10ms window noise — bucket is the signal).
Committed d87cb4b. Window hazard logged: three consecutive windows read
528-556 both arms with no foreign process >50% CPU — thermal inflation
from hours of sustained benching; grind-free family best remains the
first quiet run (469.39 ms / 558.5k c/s). Remaining open residual ~37
vs their grind-adjusted ~15-20; unattributed ~20 (recursive
commits/opens inside the bucket) is the next drill.

### Open drill wave 4: boundary join + blocked transpose (2026-08-27 overnight)

Peer's grind-free MT decomposition (their bench, 4 samples): open 21.46
total = initial 5.19 / recursive commits 9.88 / induce 3.17 / rest ~2 —
so the "15-20" carry was right, and our residual concentrates in three
buckets. Two fixes, certified together (paired A/B: open bucket sign
3/3, −2.8/−3.2/−8.0, avg −4.7ms; totals 2/3 — ~4ms effect in window
noise; pair 3's window degraded mid-run, pairing absorbed it):
1. **Boundary join**: the composed f-fold (DRAM-bound, full-witness
   read) and the residual-b1 build (L1-gather-bound byte-table folds)
   ran back-to-back; they're data-independent at the boundary →
   rayon::join (compute-under-bandwidth, the AB-hoist pattern).
   Initial sumcheck 11.3 → 8.5-9.8 (their 5.19 — asked how).
2. **Blocked dense transpose** in the sparse induce: the dense remainder
   ran one full 32MB sweep per layer (10 layers); layers whose blocks
   fit 2MB now run together over L2-resident chunks (blocks nest, so a
   chunk at the run's lowest layer contains whole blocks of every
   higher layer): ~640MB traffic → ~130MB. Induce 6.6-8.5 → 5.4-6.7
   (their 3.17). Equality test extended with a rate-1/4 blocked shape.
NULL: twiddle-width census (hypothesis: fused-2 loses the 3-PMULL
half-width path on mid layers) — only the 2 deepest layers are
half-width at dim 18/24; the static gate is already right. No change.
Recursive commits 14.3-15.5 vs their 9.88: our L1 NTT deep is at the
PMULL floor and merkle at the blake3 floor per component math —
anatomy question sent to peer (different decomposition / overlap /
config?). Open now ~30-33 vs their 21.5.

### Recursive fill fusion CERTIFIED (2026-08-27 overnight)

Peer per-level anatomy: their recursive commits skip the replicate fill
— first NTT pass writes the codeword straight from the compact message
(fill 0.00, their L1 ntt 3.1-3.4). Our tree already HAD the mechanism:
forward_transform_interleaved_from_message, built for the main commit,
adjudicated NULL there (compute-limited join window, 6-2 against), and
reverted into scratchpad/fillfuse.patch. Resurrected the NTT-side
machinery verbatim and switched ONLY ligero_commit (recursive path) to
it — the main commit stays on replicate (null verdict stands; the
recursive commits are standalone + bandwidth-bound, which is why it
pays here). L1 fill 0.5→0.00, all-in NTT 5.2-6.9→5.0-5.2; recursive
commits 14.3-15.5→12.9-13.3 (their 9.88; residual = their radix-8
kernel shape, parked). PAIRED A/B: open sign 3/3 (−2.35/−1.60/−0.56,
avg −1.5), totals 3/3. FLOCK_NO_FILL_FUSE=1 kills (same-binary A/B).

### Boundary FUSION (join → single sweep) — phase-certified (2026-08-27)

Read their materialize_direct_fold8 directly (Benedikt owns both trees):
one witness sweep produces f1 AND b1 AND the round-0 message — the b1
gathers + factored eq products run in the witness stream's stall slots,
fold accumulates unreduced (fold_banked_slot). Ported the idea as
fold_boundary_fused_par: replaces the rayon::join; suffix eq kept
factored (eq_lo⊗eq_hi, never built); lag fold via mul_unreduced + one
reduce. The standalone split-fold null INVERTS under fusion (logged
where the null was recorded). Boundary pair 7.3-8.4 → 5.5-5.7; initial
sumcheck 8.5-9.8 → 5.9-6.0 (their 5.19). CERTIFICATION: bucket-level
A/B inconclusive (−0.2/+10.1 outlier/0.0 in a noisy window — a ~2ms
effect under ±5ms noise); per-phase paired A/B (same binaries, same
window, init_min per run) 3/3 DISJOINT: 5.85/6.04/6.59 vs
7.52/8.40/8.13, avg −1.9. Proof-identity + full suite green.

NULL: pooled densify buffer in the induce (scratch take + parallel zero
+ right-sized copy-out vs fresh vec![ZERO; 2^21]) — induce 6.1-7.1 vs
5.4-6.7 baseline windows, the 16MB copy-out eats the fault savings at
32MB scale. The allocation rule pays at witness scale (128-512MB), not
here. Reverted.

### JOINT GRIND-FREE CROSS-TREE TABLE (2026-08-27 ~05:00, m=32 blake CPU-only 8T)

First fully-honest table of the campaign: both trees grind-free
(FLOCK_NO_GRIND=1), GPU off, strict slot alternation in one window
(theirs #N then ours #N), both sides' timed paths previously fixed.

  pair1: theirs 392.44 ms / 667,992 c/s   ours 477.93 / 548,497   1.218x
  pair2: theirs 388.75 ms / 674,319 c/s   ours 469.02 / 558,920   1.207x
  pair3: theirs 391.35 ms / 669,849 c/s   ours 475.33 / 551,497   1.215x
  best-vs-best: 469.02 vs 388.75 = 1.206x

Per-phase mins across slots — open: theirs 20.6-21.7 vs ours 29.7-31.1
(initial ~parity 5.05-5.19 vs 5.73-5.87; recursive commits 9.5-9.9 vs
11.8-12.5 = their radix-8 kernel shape; induce 2.5-2.6 vs 5.05-5.24 =
their fused densify/arena/intro-msg mechanisms, each sub-ms, below our
bloat bar — anatomy on file). Their other buckets: witness 29.1-29.9 /
commit 223.7-235.8 / zc 101.0-103.5 / lincheck 16.1-17.4. Campaign
arc: 1.36x (yesterday morning, with-grind) → 1.206x honest grind-free;
whole campaign vs origin baseline ≈ 723.9 → 469.0 ms 8T (1.54x) /
4781 → ~3370 ms ST.

### Full grind-free breakdown snapshot @ af90ba1 (2026-08-27 morning, m=32 blake 2^18)

Open ST: 145 = commits 68.1 / initial 41.9 (pair 40.2) / induce 24.4 /

### Commit attack, experiment 1 NULL: prep ∥ merkle staging (2026-08-27)

Hypothesis: pair the PMULL prep with the Merkle stage (BLAKE3 =
integer-SIMD) instead of the PMULL NTT — disjoint execution ports.
REFUTED decisively: staged join wall 306-327 vs 273 baseline; the
merkle arm inflates 55 → 150-157 beside prep (~fully additive). On M1
BLAKE3 and PMULL both issue on the NEON pipes — there is no disjoint
port pool, the compute-additive window model holds. Scheduling reshuffle
reverted (prover.rs); the commit.rs encode/merkle stage split kept
(used by experiment 2). Also measured: NTT truly solo = 158 vs 128-145
in-join windows — arm-wall readings continue to be context-dependent.

### Commit attack, experiment 2 NULL: leaf hashing fused into the NTT deep pass

Built the peer-shape fusion (per-sub-group hook in the parallel
interleaved NTT; each 2MB sub-group's leaves hashed cache-hot in the
task that finished its butterflies; merkle's 1GB codeword re-read
deleted; bit-identical root/tree/codeword by test at two shapes).
MEASURED NULL in a cooled window (kill-switch pairs, min-of-run): join
wall fused 269.5-281.5 vs staged 266.1-276.3 (sign 1/3), commit bucket
2/3, totals 1/3 — all inside ±6ms noise. The old "deletes a read, not
compute" pricing is now a measured verdict; no prep absorption
materialized either (the M1 compute-additive window model holds — their
absorption comes with a pass that is SLOWER alone by ~13ms, and
adopting slower-alone shapes only pays if absorption exceeds the
slowdown, which our kernels' shape does not exhibit). Reverted; patch
preserved in scratchpad/leaffuse.patch. COMMIT VERDICT so far: our
kernels win solo (fill 22.9 + NTT 844.7 + merkle 413 ≈ 1280 ST — NTT
repeatable to 0.13ms), the ~40ms MT bucket gap is their prep riding a
stall-rich fused pass; closing it means adopting their whole commit
architecture with uncertain net on our faster kernels. ST cross-tree
comparison pending (peer running grind-free ST decomposition).

### Commit attack, experiments 3+4 NULL: NEON fused-4 and radix-8 fused-3 top

The "aarch64 fused-4 top layers" menu item is now measured and DEAD,
with the model corrected in the process:
- NEON fused-4 (16-point rows, paired-PMULL vec2 muls): top layers
  316-323 → 794-860 ST (2.5× WORSE) — sixteen ~32MB-strided streams per
  row group break the M1 prefetcher.
- Radix-8 fused-3 (8 streams, the challenge tree's choice): 586-601 ST
  — still 1.9× worse than fused-2.
- MODEL CORRECTION: the ST top was never at the bandwidth floor. Per
  fused-2 pass: ~6.7e7 muls ≈ 67-98ms compute vs 79ms measured — the
  top layers sit AT the compute≈bandwidth balance point single-threaded,
  so wider fusion trades traffic nobody is waiting on for access
  patterns that stall. (At 8T the top IS bandwidth-bound, but the MT
  ceiling is ~10-15ms and both wider kernels regress compute.)
Both reverted. COMMIT ATTACK VERDICT: kernels are near-parity ST (our
encode+merkle 1280 vs their 1207, −6%; merkle ±6; prep ~parity); the
~40ms MT bucket gap is their single-pass commit architecture absorbing
prep in its stalls, and four replication attempts (prep∥merkle staging,
leaf fusion, fused-4, fused-3) all measured null-to-negative. Remaining
option = porting their full streaming radix-8 replicate+NTT+leaf pass:
large rewrite of the tuned NTT, uncertain net (their pass is faster ST
by ~73 but slower MT-solo by ~13 than our staged pipeline) — priced for
Benedikt's call.

### Streaming commit port (their full architecture) — MEASURED UNSUCCESSFUL, reverted

Benedikt-directed full port (no kill switch; his correct note: my
"slower MT-solo" claim was bad accounting — their 235 was prep-contended
too). Built faithfully from their source (commit.rs:489-830): deep-pass
NTT publishes ~1MiB leaf jobs (leaf hashing + aligned local parent
subtrees, hashed hot) into a bounded channel drained by utility-QoS
helper threads (E-cores); queue-full → inline; tail drained on the main
pool; shared top after (merkle top 0.03ms — locals worked). Join moved
to the P-pool when the pipeline engages (E-cores reserved for helpers).
Bit-identical (root/tree/codeword equality test at 2 shapes; suite
350 green). MEASURED, same window as a staged baseline re-run
(287-294): shallow queue (cap 4) 294-307 — inline fallback
re-serializes leaves onto P mid-transform; deep queue (no inline)
350-354 — codeword cold by drain time, staged merkle's DRAM read comes
back plus overhead. Intra-window structure: ntt+leaves 194-239 vs
staged ntt+merkle 183 — the pipeline never beats staged even inside
its own window. WHY THEIRS WINS AND OURS CAN'T (this hardware): the
architecture monetizes E-core silicon for leaf hashing; their host has
4 E-cores, ours 2 — and our all-core join ALREADY monetizes those 2
E-cores for prep compute (certified AB-hoist v2). Switching the same 2
E-cores from prep-absorption to leaf-absorption is conserved-compute
zero-sum, minus channel/QoS overhead. Patch preserved:
scratchpad/streaming_commit.patch (542 lines incl. equality test).
COMMIT PHASE FINAL VERDICT: closed-structural on M1 Max — kernels ST
near-parity, all five architecture/scheduling experiments
null-to-negative; the ~40ms MT bucket gap is E-core-count-bound, not
code-bound.

### STREAMING COMMIT CERTIFIED — the earlier verdict was wrong (2026-08-27)

Benedikt challenged the "E-core-count-bound" conclusion: their 1.2x was
measured on THIS machine. He was right — the "4-E-core host" was a
comment in their code about the ranked contest hardware, misread as the
measurement box. The real missing piece was visible in our own trace:
our pipelined ntt+leaves (194-205) was FASTER than theirs (235), but
our prep had already burned its overlap window beside a 100ms
standalone replicate-fill that their architecture doesn't have — their
from-message top eliminates the fill, so prep rides the ENTIRE window.
The main-commit fill-fusion null (staged shape: "deletes a read, not
compute") does NOT transfer to the pipeline shape, where the fill
fusion is load-bearing: it buys the prep its hiding window.

v2 = pipeline + from-message fill fusion (hook threaded through
forward_transform_interleaved_from_message_with): join wall becomes ONE
line (ntt+leaves, prep inside, merkle top 0.03ms). PAIRED A/B
(two-binary, 8-min cooldown, 3 pairs): join wall 252.5/254.7/252.8 vs
262.6/260.5/261.1 — 3/3 DISJOINT, avg −7.4; totals 482.5/463.1/456.9
vs 502.8/479.8/489.6 — 3/3 DISJOINT, avg −23. Bit-identical
(root/tree/codeword equality at 2 shapes; proof-identity; suite 350).
NEW CAMPAIGN RECORD: 456.95 ms / 573,681 c/s ≈ 1.175x vs their 388.75.
"Commit closed-structural" is RETRACTED; the architecture works on 2
E-cores once the fill is fused. Lesson for the log: a null verdict is
scoped to the architecture it was measured in.

### Ranked radix-8 top with E-core hetero tiles CERTIFIED (2026-08-27)

Second half of the streaming-commit architecture (their split-ranked
top, read from their ntt source): layers 1..9 in THREE radix-8 passes
replacing four fused-2 sweeps — layer 1 fused with the fill via the
dual-destination from-message kernel (one 512MB witness read → BOTH
replica blocks; block 0 on the XOR-only zero-root chain; outputs staged
in 8KB L1 tiles, emitted as sequential stnp bursts — the staging is
what my earlier fused-3 lacked: per-lane scatter stores defeat the
streaming-store detector and pay RFO on the fresh 1GB destination,
their note records −4% for that exact mistake); layers 4/7 in-place
radix-8 with q-resident butterflies (field lib's mul_q, no GPR
crossings; block 0 zero-root). All three passes distribute 128-row
tiles over the rayon pool AND two utility-QoS E-threads
(run_hetero_chunks, one atomic counter) — the E-cores assist the top,
then switch to leaf hashing when the deep pass publishes. Gated to the
rate-1/2 shape with n_top≤10 guard (huge shapes keep fused-2; skipping
layers 10..n_top would corrupt). Bit-identical: from_message equality
(shape (16,32,2) runs the ranked path), pipelined-commit
root/tree/codeword test, full suite. PAIRED A/B (cooled, 3 pairs):
commit join wall 256.6/259.4/266.7 vs 273.1/273.2/275.5 — 3/3
DISJOINT, avg −13.1; commit bucket 3/3; totals 2/3 (pair-1 new-arm
total was a Chrome-window outlier, its commit wall still won).
Commit window now ~256-267 warm ≈ ~240s cool-window basis vs their
224-236. Fused-3 verdict CORRECTED: the kernel shape (q-resident +
staged NT stores), not the radix, was what failed before.

### JOINT TABLE 2 (2026-08-27 afternoon): ratio ~1.2, UNCHANGED within noise

  pair1: theirs 389.83 (672,460)   ours 467.88 (560,278)   1.200x
  pair2: theirs 378.15 (693,226)   ours 465.22 (563,485)   1.230x
  pair3: theirs 402.44 (651,389)   ours 485.22 (540,253)   1.206x
  best-vs-best: 465.22 vs 378.15 = 1.230x  (morning: 1.206x)

Their spread alone is 6% (378-402, commit 219-241) with NO code changes
on their side (verified: their last commit Aug 18, same 7-file diff) —
the per-pair ratio noise floor is ±3%. HONEST RECONCILIATION of today's
afternoon commit work: bucket-level cross-window truth = commit 273.4
(morning calm) → ~263 (best current samples) ≈ −11, NOT the −36 the
stacked within-window certs implied. The streaming-commit A/B's totals
line (−23, 3/3) overstated its bucket line (−7, 2/3) — the bucket was
the truthful number, and part of the totals margin was window texture
that survived alternation. Ranked top's −13 wall partially overlaps in
the bucket view. Rule reinforced: certify on the phase/bucket the
mechanism lives in; totals inherit too much window. Current calm-basis
gap decomposition: commit +35-40 (ours ~263 vs theirs 219-241 — their
remaining edge = deep pair fusion + whole-prove epool depth), zc +20
(r2 anchor+delta priced −5..8/800 lines), open +7, lincheck +3,
witness +1. Ours slot-3 zc bucket read 174.2 in its traced run —
polluted sample, excluded from analysis.

### Whole-prove epool pass: 1 keep, 2 reverts (2026-08-27 evening)

Three compute-bound sites hetero-tiled (rayon pool + 2 utility-QoS
E-threads via run_hetero_chunks[_stateful]; streaming zc r2/tail and
lincheck excluded per the standing bandwidth-on-bandwidth null). Cooled
paired A/B, per-site buckets:
- KEEP zc r1 gather drain: r1 line 34.38-34.67 vs 34.98-35.14, 3/3
  disjoint, −0.53ms. The fold/reduce became run_hetero_chunks_stateful;
  values order-free.
- REVERT open boundary pass + recursive-commit merkle leaves: open
  bucket 1/3 with negative lean (+3.0/−1.1/+0.5) — per-call helper
  spawn/QoS churn exceeds what 2 E-cores add on 3-6ms passes. The
  epool pattern needs passes ≥ ~30ms to amortize on this host.
Cool-window state: HEAD (old arm) 461.1-461.8; new arm best 458.64 ms
/ 571,574 c/s — NEW RECORD. run_hetero_chunks gained the ST guard
(inline at 1 thread, parity preserved) and a stateful variant.
### zc COMPACT VARIANT K ported (r2..r5 in two passes) — CERTIFIED, DEFAULT ON

Full port of their compact round-2 architecture (read from source;
~700 lines): (1) PRODUCER uni_skip_fold_round23_compact_padded — one
sweep over the packed rows yields the 48B/pair compact state (anchor =
fold(row0); delta = packed-byte XOR, still in the bit domain), round
2's wire message, AND round 3's as six deferred quadratic coefficients:
products parity-split over pair index (eq2(2y+1) = r1·eq3(y)), one
odd-lane weight per group, κ=(1+r1)/r1 rebalance, single r1^-1 unscale.
Replaces our two-sweep lookahead r2 (fold+store then L2 re-read) with
ONE sweep and 25% smaller stores. (2) DEGENERATE-B fast path (theirs):
all-ones packed b rows skip their 16 table lookups (fold(0xFF..) is a
per-table constant), delta_b = 0, and the G(∞)/e/o products carry
provably-zero factors — value-preserving, targeted-tested with b ≡ 1
half-domains. (3) CONSUMER fold2_compact_round45_into — binds ρ1 AND
ρ2 through two λ-scaled byte tables (λ1 = ρ1(1+ρ2), λ3 = ρ1ρ2; the
anchors need only an ordinary ρ2 fold), emits round 4's message,
materializes the quarter level, and defers round 5's message in ρ3 by
the same parity trick — after which OUR cascade tail resumes its
ordinary cadence (entry i=3, ρ3/ρ4 deferred; the loop invariant holds
unchanged). NEON arms throughout (q-resident folds, 8 wide unreduced
accumulators, u64-pair delta stores); scalar references kept as the
non-aarch64 arm and oracle. Transcript-identical by two tests (random
+ degen-b targeted) at m=16/18; full suite green. Gates: n_mlv ≥ 7,
n_out ≥ 1024, r[k_skip+1] ≠ 0, r[k_skip+3] ≠ 0 (parity unscalings;
each fails w.p. 2^-128) — fallback = incumbent cascade route.

CERTIFICATION (same-binary env arms, 8-min cooldown, 3 pairs): producer
(r2 line) 47.96/50.50/50.97 vs classic 54.29/55.27/55.88 — 3/3
disjoint; K double fold 23.7-24.6; tail 8.2-8.9 vs 31.6-32.0.
MECHANISM SUM (r2 + K + tail): 79.9/83.2/84.5 vs 85.9/87.2/87.9 —
3/3 DISJOINT, avg −4.9ms (on the −5..8 pricing). zc bucket 2/3 with
one polluted K sample (141.5 vs its own min-sum ~118); totals 2/3 —
bucket rule applied. DEFAULT ON; FLOCK_NO_ZC_COMPACT_K=1 kills
(cascade precedent). zc sub-line sums now ≈117 vs their ≈116 —
ZEROCHECK AT PARITY on like instrumentation. Their remaining r2
number includes GPU-arm machinery we correctly skip (CPU-only rule).

### FULL CROSS-CERTIFICATION, ST + MT (2026-08-27 evening, grind-free,
GPU off, strict alternation; cooldown skipped per Benedikt — warm
absolutes, paired-valid ratios)

MT (m=32 blake 8T):
  pair1: ours 457.58 (572,895)  theirs 385.17 (680,587)  1.188x
  pair2: ours 460.04 (569,832)  theirs 384.91 (681,058)  1.195x
  pair3: ours 463.93 (565,045)  theirs 380.21 (689,479)  1.220x
  best-vs-best: 457.58 vs 380.21 = 1.203x
  our buckets: witness 30.0-30.4 / commit 262.9-263.8 / zc 115.4-121.1
  / lincheck 18.6-22.7 / open 29.0-30.6; theirs: 29.0-29.2 /
  221.9-251.5 / 100.4-102.2 / 16.1-16.2 / 20.6-21.2.

ST (1T):
  pair1: ours 3.25s (80,728)  theirs 2.82s (93,005)  1.152x
  pair2: ours 3.25s (80,621)  theirs 2.81s (93,248)  1.157x
  our buckets (repeatable to 0.2%): witness 230-231 / commit
  1266.5-1266.9 / zc 1486-1487 / lincheck 124.8-125.3 / open 143.6-146;
  theirs: 204-214 / 1630-1650 (their prep inside) / 757-759 / 115.5 /
  101.5-101.8. Bucket-boundary caveat: at 1T their r1 prep lives in
  commit, ours in zc — only totals and like-for-like compare.

READING: ST 1.15-1.16x vs MT 1.19-1.22x — the kernels are within ~15%
single-threaded (their generated-asm/16-bit-Horner margins, adjudicated
below bar), and the extra MT spread is the commit-window scheduling
residual (five experiments adjudicated null; their absorption exceeds
ours by ~30-40ms at 8T). Compact-K visible in both axes: zc MT 115-121
(was 121-134), zc ST 1487 (was 1531). CAMPAIGN TOTALS at certification:
MT 723.9 → 457.6 ms = 1.58x; ST 4781 → 3250 = 1.47x; cross-tree gap
1.49x (ranked discovery) → 1.36x (yesterday) → 1.19-1.22x MT /
1.15-1.16x ST certified.

### r1 prep structured-b shortcuts CERTIFIED (2026-08-27, no-cooldown protocol)

What "the 16-bit thing" turned out to be: the shift_reduce 16-bit
geometric-eq machinery is ALREADY OURS (identical mechanism, ported at
r1 parity long ago) — the stale "16-bit Horner as remaining margin"
attribution in earlier entries is hereby CORRECTED. The real adjacent
gap was their prep kernel's structured-b runtime shortcuts, now ported
(generic dispatch only; their ranked-census constants stay adjudicated
as noise): (1) all-ones 8-K b-block → a-only kernel (extension of the
constant-one row is constant one ⇒ y_K = ntt_a: no b gathers, no
product muls; our x4-table/x2-mul weight decomposition preserved);
(2) single-live-K0 block → one dual transform + one lane multiply
(zero rows contribute nothing). Two integer compares per block; exact.
Naive-oracle test with CRAFTED b (all-ones + single-K0 quarters —
random data never hits these paths) + suite 353 + proof-identity.
CERTIFIED under the new no-cooldown protocol (6 pairs, add-pairs-not-
minutes): join wall 5/6 for new, avg −5.7 (new 252.5-259.7 tight vs
old 257.5-271.4); r1-drain and zc lines flat (correct controls — the
kernel runs in the hoisted prep). NEW RECORD pair-5: 454.70 ms /
576,521 c/s. SECOND CORRECTION: the earlier "zc sub-line parity ~117
vs ~116" compared our cool numbers to their warm sub-line medians —
their zc BUCKET is 100-102, so zerocheck retains +14-19 MT post
compact-K; the parity claim is withdrawn.

### FINAL CAMPAIGN TABLE (2026-08-27 evening, grind-free, strict
alternation, no cooldowns — both sides ~1% warm, ratios paired-valid)

MT (m=32 blake 8T, GPU off):
  ours   469.66 / 464.50 / 467.86 ms   (best 564,362 c/s)
  theirs 381.77 / 382.60 / 383.30 ms   (best 686,648 c/s)
  pairs 1.230 / 1.214 / 1.221 — best-vs-best 464.50/381.77 = 1.217x
  buckets ours:   witness 30.3-30.7 / commit 261.7-266.0 / zc
  119.5-124.7 / lincheck 19.2-19.3 / open 28.3-30.1
  buckets theirs: 28.9-29.1 / 220.9-224.0 / 99.5-100.2 / 16.2-16.5 /
  21.1-22.2

ST (1T):
  ours 3.24 / 3.23 s (buckets repeatable ≤0.3%: witness 230.6-231.0 /
  commit 1265.9-1269.8 / zc 1465.2-1468.3 / lincheck 124.0-124.5 /

  theirs 2.82 / 2.84 s (204.0-204.6 / 1660-1690 incl. their prep /

  pairs 1.149 / 1.137 — best-vs-best 3.23/2.82 = 1.145x (campaign-best
  ST; zc 1465 = compact-K + structured-b at 1T, was 1531 this morning)

MT+GPU (theirs only; we are CPU-only by campaign rule):
  theirs 261.44 / 246.74 ms (1,002,687 / 1,062,409 c/s) — GPU absorbs
  commit (220-224 → 124-152) and assists zc r2 (100 → 86-88); vs our
  CPU MT best: 464.50/246.74 = 1.883x.

CAMPAIGN CLOSE: baseline → final: MT 723.9 → 454.70 record / 464.50
this table (1.56-1.59x); ST 4781 → 3230 (1.48x). Cross-tree CPU gap:
1.49x (ranked discovery) → 1.36x → 1.217x MT / 1.145x ST certified.
Kept optimizations: 20+ certified with paired sign tests; nulls: 20+
measured and reverted with written verdicts; every remaining delta
attributed (commit MT scheduling ~35-40, zc +14-19 bucket, open +7,
kernel-generation ST margins) and adjudicated below the bloat bar.

### Repo cleanup: production flags & TEMP probes stripped (2026-08-27)

Removed per Benedikt (features are certified default-on; production
never toggles them): env kill switches FLOCK_NO_ZC_LOOKAHEAD,
FLOCK_NO_ZC_COMPACT_K, FLOCK_NO_OPEN_DIRECT, FLOCK_NO_FILL_FUSE,
FLOCK_NO_AB_HOIST, FLOCK_NO_WITNESS_ELIDE, FLOCK_NO_PREFAULT,
NTT_DEEP_NOFUSE(+static), NTT_DEEP_PCORES_ONLY(+static),
MERKLE_PCORES_ONLY(+static), PCS_COMBINE_PCORES_ONLY,
LINCHECK_PCORES_ONLY, LIG_LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE; TEMP probes: combine_probe
module + open_combine_probe bench + Cargo entry, FLOCK_NTT_SPLIT
top/deep timers, LIG_COMMIT_TRACE per-level commit probe. KEPT: test
oracles as atomics only (OPEN_DIRECT_DISABLE, RS_TAIL_LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE,
ZC_COMPACT_K_DISABLE — the compact-K transcript tests had gone VACUOUS
at the default-on flip [both arms ran compact]; converted FORCE→DISABLE
so the oracle arm is real again); instrumentation used by committed
tooling (FLOCK_PHASE_TSV, FLOCK_ZC_TIMING, FLOCK_COMMIT_TIMING,
*_TRACE family); FLOCK_NO_GRIND (the measurement protocol itself);
FLOCK_ALLCORE (hardware-topology escape hatch, not a feature toggle).
Consequence for future work: same-binary feature A/B is gone for these
— use two-binary git-arm A/Bs. Post-cleanup sanity run: 472.75 ms warm
with all certified defaults engaged; suite 353 + proof-identity +
compact-K oracles green.

### Streamed witness→prep NULL — the strongest bandwidth-on-bandwidth
confirmation of the campaign (2026-08-27 evening)

Built the streamed round-1 prep (Benedikt-directed try): witness groups
publish completion on a channel; two utility-QoS E-threads run the
matching prep chunks (contiguous a/b regions — prefix-friendly, unlike
the commit's strided first pass, whose literal streaming caps at ~4ms
and was ruled out on inspection); the commit-window prep arm finishes
the remainder. IT WORKED MECHANICALLY: prep arm 97→18 (80% streamed),
commit join wall 261→182-194, witness bucket flat, roundtrip+verify
green. BUT totals 465→690-710 (+240!). Discrimination: zero consumers
→ normal; no-op consumers (threads+channel, no work) → normal;
prefaulter QoS raised → no change. VERDICT: the prep's memory work on
2 E-cores during the WRITE-SATURATED witness window collapses the
P-pool's streaming throughput — ~60 thread-ms of E work costs ~240
wall-ms (reads of freshly-written a/b lines add coherence traffic on
top of 512MB of competing stores). 5th bandwidth-on-bandwidth
confirmation, and the sharpest: the same E-cores+prep pairing that WINS
inside the commit window (AB-hoist, certified) is catastrophic inside
the witness window. E-core value is entirely window-boundedness-
dependent. Reverted; patch (631 lines incl. chunked prep API) in
scratchpad/streamed_prep.patch.

## MAIN-MERGE PHASE (2026-08-28 →)

Directive: adopt main's protocol (676 commits: recursion_circuit, f256
two-point OOD, ag-union, lagrange-const-denom, legacy-hardening, bloat
phase 1, tower-split), merging mainline PRs one at a time, keeping our
kernel/substrate performance work wherever it still has a live call
path, and re-porting the rest as measured follow-ups.

### Merge step 1: PR #26 recursion_circuit (600a901) — 2026-08-28

**Scope surprise:** the upstream feature branches cross-merged, so
#26's tip already carries the f256 configs, the two-point-OOD f256
split opening, the union (lane-major, integer-lane) commit transport,
per-challenge grinding, and the sparse (M6) zerocheck tail. The
protocol jump lands HERE; later steps should be much smaller.

**53 conflicts.** Resolution policy: main wins protocol semantics
(configs, grinding schedule, opening structure, drivers); ours wins
kernels/substrate. Per-file outcomes:

- 42 config TOMLs: theirs (f256, queries 279, fold_grinding 0,
  claim/consistency batch grinding, ood_samples). Our blake3 hash
  default REVERTED to main's sha256 (generator + derivation test are
  main's; flipping the default is a one-commit DECISION ITEM for
  later — benches select blake3 via FLOCK_MERKLE_HASH/FLOCK_FS_HASH,
  which survived). hash.rs default likewise back to Sha256; our two
  default-hash tests updated.
- scratch.rs: hand-merged. Theirs' pool upgrades kept (4x capacity
  window, class-aware eviction, POOL_TRACE, f256 view pool, zero pool,
  prewarm budget/union) + our provenance-tag API re-applied on top
  (tagged tuples, take/give_f128_tagged). Their U8_POOL replaces our
  duplicate POOL_U8.
- additive_ntt_f128.rs: hand-merged. Theirs' integer-lane + live-lane
  (dead-lane skip) machinery + parallelism floor kept; our on_sub
  per-sub-group hook, from_message fusion, ranked radix-8 top and
  interleaved_n_top helper kept (helper updated to ceil_log2 for
  integer lanes). Both sides' tests kept.
- pcs/commit.rs: hand-merged. Theirs' lane-major commit
  (commit_lane_major, dense_lanes, finalize_commit, cap-based
  Commitment) + our streaming pipelined commit + stage split kept;
  pipelined path now emits the cap; pipeline gated to pow2 lanes
  (integer-lane goes lane-major/staged); pow2 msg-len asserts
  loosened to msg_len_f128().
- pcs.rs, ligerito.rs, ring_switch.rs: THEIRS WHOLESALE (f256-split
  opening is a rewrite; our f128 direct-open, boundary fusion,
  composed-table sweep, lazy-OOD glue have no call path in it).
  RE-PORT CANDIDATES, assessed against the new opening.
- zerocheck.rs: THEIRS WHOLESALE (grinding + sparse-M6 driver).
  multilinear.rs hand-merged: theirs' generic kernel restructure +
  runs/sparse machinery kept, our integrated-lookahead round 2 and
  compact-K section re-appended (adapted to single-run
  round2_pair_skip). Driver wiring for cascade/compact-K NOT yet
  re-grafted — RE-GRAFT ITEM (transcript-identical, so it layers
  cleanly).
- prover.rs, r1cs_hashes/blake3.rs: THEIRS WHOLESALE (union driver;
  auto-merge garbled ours in). Lost for now: stripe-C zerocheck entry,
  AB-hoist (gate returns false with note — its consumer is the
  stripe-C entry), tagged witness give-backs, streamed full-write
  witness builder + provenance elision. All RE-GRAFT ITEMS. prove_fast
  now runs the UNION prover; prove_fast_timed decomposes the legacy
  direct path (bench labeled accordingly; union breakdown via
  PCS_TRACE=1).

**Tests:** flock-core 563 green, flock-prover 114 green, ignored
roundtrips green (batch-major prove_fast, prove_fast_ag, ligerito
roundtrip, const-pin). Two auto-merge stitch bugs caught at compile
(fused_2layer_row_op arity, build_b_med_counts arity); one caught by
tests (pipelined commit cap). Lesson re-confirmed: auto-merged regions
of co-evolved files are STITCH HAZARDS — the failures were loud, but
only because main's test additions (derivation test, l0-matches-full)
covered them.

**Step-1 bench snapshot** (m=32, grind-free, blake3 via env, warm,
single session — indicative, not certified):
- Union headline prove_fast: best 879.5 ms (runs 1.13 s / 879.5 ms /
  1.11 s) vs 465 ms pre-merge = 1.89x. Peak memory 8.93 GB. Proof
  567.31 KiB (was 427.30).
- Union phases (PCS_TRACE, warm run): commit 259 ms (staged lane-major
  — no streaming pipeline on this path yet), boolean zerocheck +
  lincheck 284–458 ms (noisy; no compact-K/cascade), open 266–297 ms
  (f256 split: W build ~40, merged sumcheck ~18–37, inner ligerito
  ~193–222), witgen ~free (batch-major partial + zero pool).
- Legacy direct path (prove_fast_timed, one cool run): witness 51 ms,
  commit 193 ms, zerocheck 1.56 s (!!), lincheck 84 ms, open 393 ms.
  The 1.56 s zc is an OPEN ITEM — smells like the generic run-list
  (scalar) round-2 kernel or a mis-gated fast path on the direct
  spec; investigate during the zc re-graft.

**Re-port/re-graft queue** (each as its own measured commit, after the
remaining merge steps land): (1) zc cascade + compact-K driver wiring
onto the grinding driver; (2) streaming/pipelined commit for the
lane-major union L0; (3) stripe-C + AB-hoist onto the union/direct
drivers; (4) streamed witness builder + provenance elision for the
batch-major generator; (5) direct-open/boundary-fusion ideas vs the
f256-split opening (assess — the opening changed shape); (6) direct
path zc 1.56 s anomaly; (7) DECISION: flip default hash to blake3
repo-wide (generator + TOMLs + tests) or keep sha256 default with env
selection for benches.

### Merge step 2: PR #32 f256-lookahead (372d323) — 2026-08-28

Clean merge, ZERO conflicts (step 1 absorbed the cross-merged bulk).
+1459/-120 over 11 files, dominated by ligerito/extension.rs (f256
tower extension fold machinery + fold-lookahead tests). Suites green
(core 564, prover 117). m=32 grind-free blake3, 3 cold-start runs:
1.90 / 1.17 / 1.15 s (step 1 same protocol: 1.85 / 1.34 / 1.19) —
PARITY within session noise; proof size unchanged (567.31 KiB), peak
8.52 GB.

### Merge step 3: PR #33 ag-union (6ee974f) — 2026-08-28

Clean merge, zero conflicts. +4727/-555 over 20 files: AG-skip union
integration (genus95 round 1, ag_skip driver, tower.rs expansion,
union verifier work, 128-bit grinding audit doc). Suites green (core
572, prover 118). m=32 grind-free blake3 cold-start: 1.66 / 1.12 /
1.79 s, best 1.12 — parity (run-3 spike looks environmental); proof
size unchanged.

### Merge step 4: PR #10 lagrange-const-denom (via abe3df1 fmt tip) — 2026-08-28

3ff5d29 was already in ancestry (absorbed by the cross-merged
branches); this merge added only the fmt commit's merkle_path.rs delta
(+52/-19). Suites green (core 572, prover 120). Bench cold-start:
2.27 / 2.15 / 0.948 s — best 948 ms, parity; first-two-run spikes look
like memory-pressure churn from back-to-back 8.5 GB bench sessions
(the certified comparison comes after the re-grafts, with proper
alternation).

### Merge step 5: PR #34 legacy-hardening (2bb04a9) — 2026-08-28

Clean merge, zero conflicts (+186/-1: verifier/r1cs hardening checks,
small blake3/sha2 additions). Suites green (core 574, prover 122).
First bench session read 2.26/2.32/2.28 s across the board — rerun
gave 1.85/1.07/0.970 s: the slow session was machine state (788K
pageouts; back-to-back 8.5 GB bench sessions), not the PR. PARITY,
best 970 ms.

### Merge step 6: PR #37 bloat-phase1 (86d5fd5+61cff5f) — 2026-08-28

Two trivial merkle.rs hunks (kept main's MERKLE_PCORES_ONLY knob).
Main's own purge: -13,121 lines over 66 files, INCLUDING the legacy
direct-path prover (prove_fast_timed / prove_fast_ligerito_timed) —
the bench's timed breakdown block is gone with it; per-phase
attribution is now PCS_TRACE=1 only, matching main's bench. This also
retires the "direct path zc 1.56 s" open item (the path no longer
exists) and re-scopes re-graft targets to the UNION driver only.
Suites green (core 545 — count reflects deleted legacy tests, prover
124). Bench: 1.92 / 1.72 / 0.919 s, best 919 ms — parity.

### Merge step 7: PR #38 tower-split (b310f35) — 2026-08-28

Clean merge, zero conflicts (tower.rs split into
query/real_walker/tape modules; ~20K moved lines). Suites green (core
545, prover 124). Bench 1.58 / 1.18 / 1.73 s, best 1.18 — parity
(session noise; the machine has been paging all afternoon).

**MERGE COMPLETE: merge-base(HEAD, origin/main) == origin/main tip
(b310f35).** All 7 mainline PRs are in. Union prove_fast at m=32
grind-free blake3 sits at ~0.92–1.18 s best-of-3 cold-start across
steps (vs 465 ms pre-merge) — the gap is the re-graft/re-port queue
from step 1, now re-scoped to the union driver: zc cascade+compact-K,
streaming lane-major commit, stripe-C/AB-hoist, streamed witness
builder, direct-open ideas vs the f256 opening.

### Default hash → BLAKE3, repo-wide (Benedikt-directed) — 2026-08-28

Restores our pre-merge default on top of the merged tree, this time
through main's own machinery: HashKind::default() → Blake3, the
security-config generator emits hash = "blake3", all 98 embedded
config TOMLs flipped (derivation test keeps generator and TOMLs
locked), FsChallenger::new() → Blake3 transcripts. Tests updated to
be default-agnostic where they pin consistency (23 test cfg literals
pinned to explicit Sha256) and flipped where they pin the default
(challenger default pin, params-inherit test, m29 TOML load, m22
roundtrip now exercises the sha256 arm + blake3-mismatch reject).
Proof-byte fixtures re-pinned by design (union_element 7,
union_m6_fixtures 6; two deterministic print runs agreed each).
Suites green (core 545, prover 124) + ignored roundtrips green with
grinding on. Bench sanity: defaults print blake3/blake3 with no env;
times in the machine's current paging-degraded band, hash config
identical to prior runs.

### Merge step 8: bloat-phase2/3 (8a36c91) + first branch-vs-main A/B — 2026-08-31

Main moved 10 commits past b310f35; merged cleanly on top of the
blake3 flip. Resolutions: the 28 retired `*_fast128`/`*_slim128`
TOMLs deleted (main's rename — Fast/Slim now CARRY the 128 schedules,
proof-IO v22; our `hash = "blake3"` line auto-merged into the
surviving files), gf2_128 wide-NEON tests moved to the shared
`test_rng::Rng` (`next_f128` → `f128`), 13 proof-byte pins
regenerated (both sides stale: v22 × blake3 default; two agreeing
deterministic print runs each). Suites green (core 557, prover
green). merge-base == origin/main tip again.

**Branch-vs-main paired A/B (m=32, grind-free, blake3/blake3 pinned
via env on BOTH arms; mainline worktree carries two measurement-only
patches: the FLOCK_NO_GRIND knob in grind_pow and the bench
verify-skip).** Totals run (8 pairs, alternating): 5/8 branch, but
the run split early-late (pairs 1–5 all branch −20..−140 ms, pairs
6–8 all main +40..+83) with mediaanalysisd at 64% CPU and the battery
fast-charging at 25–29% while DRAINING under load — both named
hazards; unadjudicable. Phase-paired run (6 pairs, PCS_TRACE
min-per-phase): commit 2/4 med +10 ms, zc+lincheck 4/2 med −7 ms
(pair swings ±150 ms — foreign load), open 3/3 med 0, total 4/2 med
−2 ms. **Verdict: no bucket certifies a difference; branch ≈ main
end-to-end within today's noise.** Consistent with the liveness
audit: the live survivors (blake3 hash8 leaf kernel, lincheck NEON
rewrite, round1 E-core drain) are tens-of-ms items under a
±50–150 ms floor; every big-ticket optimization (compact-K/cascade
zc, streaming pipelined commit, stripe-C/AB-hoist, streamed witness
builder) is present but DORMANT — no driver calls. Re-certify on a
quiet, charged machine; the real move is the re-graft queue.
Trace note: `bind statement` is ~815 ms on the first prove only
(cached after) — cold totals ~2.4 s are not a regression signal.

### ST/MT phase table, branch vs main — 2026-08-31

m=32 grind-free blake3 both arms, one invocation per cell (min per
phase over 5 proves; ST = RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1). ms:

| phase   | br MT | mn MT | ratio | br ST  | mn ST  | ratio |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| commit  | 232.0 | 227.6 | 1.019 | 1690.1 | 1718.9 | 0.983 |
| zc+linc | 226.7 | 257.7 | 0.880 | 1556.7 | 1745.7 | 0.892 |
| open    | 264.0 | 264.7 | 0.997 | 1582.2 | 1606.2 | 0.985 |
| sum     | 722.7 | 750.0 | 0.964 | 4829.0 | 5070.8 | 0.952 |

witgen/compact 0.0 everywhere (pooled-zeroed / aliased). The ONE
surviving live win that resolves: **zc+lincheck −12% MT / −11% ST** —
the ST agreement pins it on the lincheck NEON block-kernel rewrite
(load-port fix), not scheduling; the round1 E-drain adds little
beyond it at MT. commit and open are parity (hash8 leaf kernel gain
is inside the ±2% floor here). Sum-of-buckets ≈ prove TOTAL −~12 ms
unlabeled residue. `bind statement` one-time ~790 ms in all four
cells (identical arms). ST/MT scaling ≈ 6.7× on 8 P-cores. Caveats:
single cell per config, machine on 24% battery with interactive load;
earlier trace-parse footgun fixed (open_batch/open_merged also print
"TOTAL" — match "[prove_union] TOTAL").

### Re-graft #1: zc compact-K + cascade wired onto the union grinding driver — 2026-08-31

Ported the f035ddb round-2 branch (compact-K rounds 2..5 | integrated
r2 lookahead | classic) and the 4→1 cascade tail into main's grinding
driver: unified while-loop with `rho_prev`/`pending2` deferred-
challenge state, one `sample_rho!` grind-or-sample per round message
(nonce cadence identical on every route), two-challenge final binding.
All kernels had survived in multilinear.rs; zerocheck.rs re-gains the
two test oracles (ZC_COMPACT_K_DISABLE, RS_TAIL_LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE) and
the three transcript-identity tests. New `PaddingSpec::
effective_single_run()` — as_single_run modulo trailing all-zero runs
(the fast path's implicit gap) — lets the single-type union's
gap/useful/tail list serve the single-run kernels.

**Measured verdict — sparse keeps the bench.** The union boolean
region at m=32 is ~19% occupied (useful_cols/128), so main's
support-proportional sparse path fires; with cascade priority forced,
compact-K's producer pays a full-domain pass: r2+K+tail 145–190 ms vs
sparse r2+tail 93–170 (K fold 31–48 + cascade tail 11–15 ARE cheaper
than the sparse tail's 44–103, but the producer eats it). The old −5
certification was on a ~fully-occupied witness; main's sparsity
banked that win differently. Priority reverted: sparse dispatches
first, the cascade serves dense single-run flows (where the sparse
occupancy gate fails and the 2026-08-27 certification applies).
Dispatch is visible under FLOCK_ZC_TIMING ("gates:" line).

Suites: core 560 (3 new oracle tests), prover 76, all 13 proof pins
UNCHANGED — transcript identity of every route, enforced. Takeaway
for the queue: today's zc cost is round1 URM ~120 ms — stripe-C/
AB-hoist (item #3) is the zc money now, not round 2/tail.

### Re-graft #3 attempt: round-1 AB hoist onto the union commit — NULL, reverted — 2026-08-31

Wired the certified 2026-08-27 join (prep beside commit on the
all-core pool; `Round1AbPre` threaded through
`prove_packed_padded_capture_s_hat_v_c_with_grinding`) onto the union
driver. Mechanism buckets moved exactly as designed — round1 URM
120 → 53–56 ms (6/6, −61 median), zc+lincheck −60 (6/6) — but the
commit wall paid +52 (0/6): **net total 5/6 at only −3..−11 ms, a
wash.** Second variant split `commit_lane_major` into fill/finalize
and joined the prep beside NTT+Merkle only (the fill is the
streamed-prep null's write-saturated phase): the fill ran clean
(82 → 24 ms) but the NTT absorbed the same contention (90 → 150–160)
— identical wall.

The arithmetic says why, and it generalizes: the prep is ~480
thread-ms; the union commit window is ALREADY all-core dense (the
deep NTT pass recruits the E-cores itself, unlike the 2026-08-27
tree), so overlap is zero-sum — wall grows by work/threads ≈ 48 ms
for the 60 the zerocheck saves. There is no idle-slack window in this
prover for challenge-independent prep to hide in; a future hoist only
pays off if some phase leaves cores (not bandwidth) idle. Reverted
per the measured-revert rule; suites stayed green throughout and the
transcript never moved (prep is bit-identical by construction).

### Re-graft #2: lane-major streaming commit — UNCERTIFIED, parked — 2026-08-31

Ported the leaf pipeline to the union's integer-lane commit: factored
`commit_into_pipelined`'s queue/helper engine into `leaf_pipeline_run`,
added a lane-major variant (staged transpose fill, then the live-lane
NTT deep pass publishing whole-position blocks — non-pow2 lane counts
align by construction, so the pow2 gate is not needed there), plus a
staged-vs-pipelined byte-identity oracle at non-pow2 t. Mechanically
correct: merkle-top 116 → 0.2 ms, smoke commit 239–249 vs staged
~250–270.

**12 paired A/B vs 9c119e5, two rounds: commit bucket 6/12 med +2 ms,
totals 6/12 med +3 — consistent with zero.** Round 1's apparent zclc
+19 side effect vanished in round 2 (machine texture, not the change).
Reading: the queue fills and most leaf hashing lands inline on the
publisher anyway — the work relocates into the NTT window; the real
saving is only the codeword's DRAM re-read (~25 ms theoretical at
m=32) and pipeline overhead eats most of it. Conditions were the worst
of the day (19% battery, net-draining on AC, interactive load).

PARKED on branch `regraft-2-lane-pipeline` (pushed) with the oracle
test — re-run the A/B on a quiet charged machine, and at m=30/34
where the codeword (and the re-read) is larger. Not merged: does not
earn its ~120 lines on this evidence.

### Zerocheck route A/B: sparse vs compact-K+cascade, SAME BINARY — 2026-08-31

`FLOCK_SPARSE_GATE` (the existing env override on `SPARSE_TAIL_GATE`)
makes the round-2 dispatch a same-binary A/B: gate=1 (default) takes
main's sparse route, gate=huge forces the dense route, which now fires
the re-grafted compact-K + cascade. 8 pairs, alternating, min-of-5 per
invocation, m=32 grind-free blake3. ms:

| bucket        | sparse | dense/cascade | sign |
|---------------|--------|---------------|------|
| round1 URM    | 117.6  | 118.0         | 5/8 (unaffected — same code) |
| round 2       |  43.4  | 101.7         | 8/8 sparse |
| compact-K fold|   —    |  30.3         | — |
| rounds 3+ tail|  44.9  |  10.6         | **0/8 sparse — cascade 4.2× faster** |
| r2+K+tail     |  89.3  | 142.7         | 8/8 sparse |
| zc+lincheck   | 239.3  | 288.7         | 8/8 sparse |

**Both halves are 8/8 disjoint, in OPPOSITE directions.** Sparse owns
round 2 (−58 ms: it never materializes the dead region the compact
producer sweeps); the cascade owns the tail (−34 ms: one 4→1 pass
serves two rounds, and our dispatch currently forces an UNFUSED tail
whenever round 2 went sparse — `tail_cascade` requires
`dense_single_run`, zerocheck.rs:842). Neither route is optimal. A
hybrid — sparse (or sparse-compact) round 2 handing a compacted state
to a SPARSE 4→1 lookahead kernel — targets ~54 ms where we now pay
89.3, i.e. ~−35 ms on the zc bucket. That kernel does not exist in
either tree: main has sparsity without fusion, the challenge tree has
fusion without sparsity. This is the one genuine "port the idea, not
the code" item the zerocheck has left.

CORRECTION to the re-graft #1 entry above: its "~19% occupancy" figure
was asserted from a misread of `boolean_padding_spec` and is
WITHDRAWN — the sparse route engages at this shape because
`SPARSE_TAIL_GATE = 1` makes the gate `live ≤ n` (always true), not
because the witness is very sparse. The gate's own doc describes the
intended crossover as half utilization (`live·2 > n` stays dense), so
the constant and the doc disagree; at 8/8 for sparse on round 2 the
constant is right for round 2 and wrong for the tail. Re-graft #1's
verdict (sparse keeps the bench) stands on the measurement, but its
stated cause was wrong.

### Zerocheck structural audit vs the challenge tree (Yukon) — 2026-08-31

Consulted the Yukon benchmark `eigenlabs/flock-challenge` (public notes
+ the local checkout at /Users/buenz/flock-snark-fast-mac, which IS the
challenge tree) to settle what of its zerocheck can still transfer.

**Top-level: not the same statement.** Their m32_fast.toml is
`field = "f128"`, analysis `johnson_ood_row_union_over_bchks25...`,
queries 218, fold_grinding 19. Ours is `f256`, `f256_split_johnson_
two_point_ood_query128_c3_...`, queries 244, claim-batch grinding.
Their zerocheck has ZERO grinding, ZERO sparsity, ZERO union, and a
Metal GPU commit (gpu_commit.rs, epool.rs). Scores are not comparable.

STRUCTURALLY NON-TRANSFERABLE (with their own code as evidence):
- **Everything paid for by GPU idleness.** Their AB precompute IS the
  commit window's binding arm (58.2 ms arm ≈ 58.3 ms window, GPU graph
  done 41–53 ms, 0.00 ms host wait). Their NT stores are justified
  verbatim by "the streamed GPU commit is saturating the same memory
  system"; the compact store "pays as contention relief on the commit
  arm"; their hetero P+E AB drain records itself as measured DEAD in
  the GPU-bound regime — which is ours. Matches our 0f1b5e6 null.
- **GPU-native**: round-1 C-fold GPU prefix, ZC-window GPU idle fill,
  and `stage_commit_tail_fill` (forked challenger starts work before
  the transcript confirms it, byte-inert on mismatch). CPU-only rules.
- **Shape/machine hardcodes**: the whole cascade family is gated
  `(m == 32 || cfg!(test))` (their zerocheck.rs:783); the fastest
  round-1 arm additionally requires k_log=14, useful=15_409,
  n_chunks=2^19, main_threads==10, helper_threads==4.
- **Their C fold4/fold8 tensor** feeds the direct fold4 open; our f256
  split opening has no such consumer.
- NOT a blocker: grinding. Our per-round zerocheck PoW is 2 bits
  (`multilinear_round_bits` = bits_for(2)); compact-K + cascade landed
  transcript-identical under it (9c119e5).

**STRIPE-C: attempted, REVERTED — blocked by BATCH-MAJOR layout.**
Agent tracing showed stripe-C was lost in the PR #26 merge (wired at
7b2287b, gone at 8567563) and is complete + bit-identity-tested, so it
looked like a free re-graft: C is the whole per-window bit transpose
plus 32 of the drain's 48 gathers per lane (docs/zerocheck-
optimizations.tex:311), previously −5.7% on round 1, 8/8. Wired it on
the union path (single boolean slot, `c` aliases `z`, length-checked)
— `prove_verify_ligerito_all_profiles` failed with
`Zerocheck(SumcheckFinalFailed)`. Cause: the union commits BATCH-MAJOR
(`blake3.rs:1621`, `union.rs:1140`, `schedule.rs:903`) while the
stripe fold assumes the ROW-MAJOR stripe↔witness index relation — the
challenge tree gates the same mechanism on `layout == RowMajor` for
exactly this reason. The two padding models also disagree (union: whole
dead chunk-COLUMNS; type: dead row prefix per 2^14 block). Adapting it
means deriving a batch-major stripe fold, not porting one. Reverted;
suites green.

CORRECTED OCCUPANCY: the union boolean region at m=32 is **71.875%**
useful (useful_bits = 11_707, k_log = 14, nu = 18 ⇒ useful_cols =
ceil(11707/128) = 92 of 128; 376,832 of 524,288 windows live). The
"~19%" in zerocheck.rs and two log entries above is wrong by ~3.8x.
Round 1 DOES scale with this fraction — the AB prep, the C transpose
and the drain all sit behind one `continue` on `n_b_med == 0`.

### AG vs RS: the bench measures the wrong path, and ab_eq_fold has no AG landing spot — 2026-08-31

**`Blake3Setup::prove_fast` (what blake3_proof benches, and every
zerocheck number in this log today) takes the RS union path.** The AG
path is a separate entry, `prove_fast_union_ag` →
`prove_fast_ligerito_union_ag` → `BooleanZcKind::Ag`
(blake3.rs:1726, prover.rs:675/770). Main is actively developing AG
(38468bc, 4aef9ad, e661940 on origin/main).

**AG's zerocheck is already ahead of RS's.** `ag_breakdown` at m=32,
3 reps, 10 threads (medians):

| AG phase | ms |
|---|---|
| round-1 URM (banks fused) | 66.7 |
| skip→mlv fold (byte-dot u64) | 115.4 |
| TOTAL prove (lookahead) | **164.2** |
| [classic tail, no lookahead] | [283.5] |

versus the RS path's ~206 ms of zerocheck at the same m (round1 117.6
+ r2 43.4 + tail 44.9, measured in the gate A/B above). **AG round 1
is 43% cheaper than RS round 1**, and inside AG the *fold*, not round
1, is the dominant phase.

**AG already implements the sparse→cascade hybrid** this log proposed
as "the win neither tree has": `mlv_tail_fs_sparse` (ag_skip.rs:1417)
runs the support-proportional rounds "while the live set clears the
gate and the domain keeps the fused threshold, then expands to dense
ONCE and resumes the lookahead tail mid-stream"
(`mlv_tail_fs_resume`, :1501). That gap is RS-driver-only; AG is the
reference implementation. Retarget the hybrid item accordingly.

**ab_eq_fold does not transfer — two independent reasons.**
1. *AG round 1 is not table-driven.* The RS mechanism works because
   the RS drain's per-chunk contribution is a convert-TABLE lookup
   indexed by a byte (256 possible values), so `eq_top` can be
   pre-multiplied into table copies once and the per-chunk multiply
   disappears. AG round 1 computes `pr = (af&bx) ^ (ax&bf)` fresh per
   block and folds it with `mul_acc_unred(res[p], eq, pr)`
   (round1.rs:259-293, 592-610) — 160 AB + 128 C = **288 multiplies
   by the same `eq_o` per block**, on full-rank 128-bit data. There is
   no table whose scaling could absorb the weight; building a
   per-block multiply table would cost ~4096 ops to save 288.
2. *The AG fold, which IS table-driven (`build_w_tables`), already
   applies eq once per block to a REDUCED SCALAR* — `let e = eo *
   d1_inv; (e * s1.reduce(), e * s_inf.reduce())` (ag_skip.rs:296-300).
   Two multiplies per block, not per lane. Nothing to fold away.

**What the fold's 115 ms actually is: bandwidth.** It reads 512 MB of
`a_packed` + 512 MB of `b_packed` and writes `a_mlv`/`b_mlv` at
`n = 2^26` F128 each = **2 GB written** (each witness bit becomes a
16-byte field element). ~3 GB of traffic ≈ 100 ms at this machine's
achievable bandwidth — it is DRAM-bound, not multiply-bound. The
transferable IDEA here is compact-K's principle, not ab_eq_fold's:
**fuse the first mlv round(s) into the fold so the full-width
intermediate is never materialized** (the code already fuses the first
*message* accumulation — "no read-back of the folded array" — but
still writes both full arrays). That targets the largest AG phase.

Round-1 candidate that IS coding-scheme-independent: the challenge
tree's static-B sniffing (~31.6% of B byte positions fixed by the
BLAKE3 circuit regardless of witness). It is a property of the R1CS,
not of RS vs AG, so it should apply to `encode_slp_derived(bp, bf)`
and simplify `product_fold_bs` terms. Premise NOT yet verified against
our BLAKE3 R1CS — measure before building.

### Static-B census on OUR BLAKE3 R1CS — idea transfers, prize is ~12%, under the bar — 2026-08-31

Measured before building (temporary structural probe over `b_0.rows`,
K = 2^14, then reverted). Counts a row as structurally constant when
it is empty (→ 0) or references only the const-wire pin (→ 1):

| matrix | constant rows | of K |
|---|---|---|
| B_0 | 6086 (4677 empty + 1409 pin-only) | 37.15% |
| A_0 | 4678 | 28.55% |

**But the 4677 empty B rows are EXACTLY the padding tail**
(K − USEFUL_BITS = 16384 − 11707 = 4677), which the run-list/coverage
machinery already skips. The genuinely new structure is the 1409
pin-only rows: **12.04% of the useful prefix**.

Clustering (a bitsliced kernel cannot skip individual bits, only whole
planes — this is what decides exploitability):

| group | all-constant groups | starting inside USEFUL |
|---|---|---|
| 64 | 95 of 256 | 22 |
| 128 (= one bitsliced plane) | 47 of 128 | **11** |
| 512 (their b_med window) | 11 of 32 | 2 |
| 8192 (one block) | 0 of 2 | 0 |

The 1409 constant useful rows are almost perfectly aligned: 11 whole
128-row groups = 1408 rows. So in AG terms, **11 of the ~92 useful
128-bit B planes are constant across every block and every instance**,
making their `encode_slp_derived` output hoistable — ~12% of the
B-side plane work, i.e. low single-digit ms against round 1's 66.7 ms.

VERDICT: the idea DOES transfer to AG (it is a property of the R1CS,
not of the code) — but our circuit yields 12%, not the challenge
tree's ~31.6% (their `useful_bits` is 15_409 of 16_384, a different
BLAKE3 encoding with a much smaller padding tail, so more of their
constant structure sits inside the live region). At ~2-3 ms, and
needing the witness-safety apparatus (runtime compare + generic
fallback) to be sound, it does not clear the bloat bar. Not built.
Recorded so nobody re-derives it.

### Fold fusion ("the swoop"): DEAD — the fold's writes are already free — 2026-08-31

`mlv_tail_fs_resume` (ag_skip.rs:1518) carries a forward reference from
main's own AG port to "the swoop's fold-level lookahead, which covers
rounds 0–1 during the witness fold" — the fusion, with the resume entry
already built for it. "swoop" appears nowhere else in the repo or its
history, so it was designed and never implemented. Priced it before
building.

FIRST, the in-prove attribution (new `[ag-zc-timing]` fold/tail split,
kept — the standalone `ag_breakdown` numbers overstate badly):

| AG phase (m=32) | standalone | **in-prove, warm** |
|---|---|---|
| round-1 URM | 66.4 | 66.4 |
| skip→mlv fold | 114.6 | **41–45** |
| mlv tail (lookahead) | — | **~54** |
| (classic tail, for scale) | — | ~174 |

So the fold is 42 ms, not 115 — the standalone figure is cold-pool +
2 GB allocation. AG zerocheck ≈ 66 + 42 + 54 ≈ 162 ms, matching the
164 ms end-to-end.

THEN three probes into `fold_block_at` (each applied, measured,
reverted):

| variant | fold ms | reading |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | 41–45 | — |
| stores removed entirely | 55–58 | **slower** |
| stores redirected to a stack buffer (2 GB DRAM traffic gone, store instructions kept) | 43–63 | **no gain** |
| Horner message chain removed (byte-dots + stores kept) | 36–43 | −4…6 ms (~12%) |

**The fold's 2 GB of state writes are free.** They hide behind the
byte-dot work; removing them changes nothing, and removing the store
instructions altogether makes it *slower* (the loop is then bound by
the serial `shl2_xor` Horner dependency rather than overlapping with
independent stores). The fold is bound by the byte-dot gathers:
`n = 2^26` outputs × 8 table lookups × 2 operands ≈ 1.07e9 gathers
≈ 36 of the 42 ms.

**Therefore fusion cannot pay.** It would eliminate writes that cost
nothing (and a 2 GB streaming read in the tail's first round) while
adding a SECOND full byte-dot pass — the one part that is actually
expensive. Materialize-vs-recompute is settled the other way here:
`a_packed` is a 2× compression of `a_mlv`, but decompressing it costs
~36 ms and storing it costs ~0. Not built.

Residual idea if the fold is ever revisited: it is gather-bound, so
the lever is the byte-dot table geometry (8 lookups/output from 8×256
F128 = 32 KiB, L1-resident). A 16-bit-index table halves the gathers
but needs 4 MiB, moving the working set to shared L2 — a real
tradeoff, not an obvious win, and worth at most ~15 ms of a 42 ms
phase that is ~5% of the prove.

### Tex/memory sweep for portable ideas; recursive-commit fill fusion NULL — 2026-08-31

Swept `docs/zerocheck-optimizations.tex` (21 documented wins) and the
campaign memory against the current tree. Status of every entry:

LIVE ALREADY: §blake3neon (merkle +41% GB/s), §lcfold (lincheck fold
−32%), §pmull/§twolane/§zeroskip (round-1 kernel work, in the aarch64
kernels main took), round-1 E-core hetero drain.

DEAD BY PROTOCOL CHANGE (verified earlier today): §directopen +
§directopenrefine (f256 split replaced the basis open), §stripe
(batch-major), §composedfold / §inducetrunc / §lazyood / §boundaryjoin
/ §blockedtranspose (all target the old open's basis-combine and
sparse-prefix induce machinery — `sparse_prefix` no longer exists, and
`ood_samples` dropped 5 → 1, shrinking §lazyood's prize 5×).
§streamwit is moot (union witgen ≈ 0 ms). §compactk/§cascade landed but
sparse wins on RS and AG already has the hybrid. §streamcommit parked.

**§recursivefill: the one entry with a live target — TRIED, NULL,
REVERTED.** `ligero_commit` (ligerito.rs:3045) still does
`replicate_message_fill` + `from_layer`, and our dormant
`from_message` machinery survives, so the swap is two lines and
byte-identical (all 13 proof pins held). Measured:

- open bucket A/B, 8 pairs: candidate won 2/8, **median +3.9 ms**
  (commit, an unaffected control phase, drifted +1.7 — so the real
  differential is ≈ +2 ms, i.e. slower).
- New `[lig-timing]` per-level line (kept) gives the mechanism
  directly — encode ms, candidate vs control:

| level (log_cols / rate) | from_message | replicate+from_layer |
|---|---|---|
| 16, 1/8 | 17.79 / 18.12 | **16.00 / 14.96** |
| 13, 1/32 | 7.10 / 6.95 | **6.63 / 6.61** |
| 10, 1/128 | 3.22 / 3.85 | 3.83 / 2.88 |
| 7, 1/512 | 1.36 | **1.29** |
| 4, 1/2048 | 0.58 | **0.39** |

Cause: **the recursive levels run at rate 1/8 … 1/2048**, not the
rate-1/2 L0 shape the fused pass is built for. At `reps ≥ 8` the
replicate is a cheap 1→2^r broadcast and the fused first pass re-reads
`poly` per replica instead; the tex's −1.5 ms was measured on the OLD
open's recursive geometry, which the f256 split changed. Third
confirmation today of the same law: **deleting memory traffic is not a
speedup unless the traffic was on the critical path.**

USEFUL BYPRODUCT — the open's internals are now visible for the first
time. At m=32 the recursive commits cost ≈ 30 ms encode + 21 ms merkle
≈ **51 ms of the 264 ms open**, with the first recursive level
(log_cols=16) alone ≈ 27 ms. So ~150 ms of the open's "inner ligerito"
is NOT commits — it is the recursive sumcheck/query/induce work, and
that is the largest unexamined block in the prover.

### Current throughput, and what the surviving wins are worth — 2026-08-31 (quiet window)

**Throughput now (production, grinding ON, verify passing):** best
prove_fast **900.62 ms = 291,072 compressions/sec** at m=32 (2^18
compressions, 8 P-cores, blake3 merkle + FS). Proof 449.76 KiB, verify
6.59 ms, peak 8.52 GB. Grind-free reads 906.73 ms / 289,110 c/s — i.e.
**grinding is now free** (main's per-challenge schedule is 2–16 bits),
so the FLOCK_NO_GRIND measurement family is nearly redundant on this
protocol; keep it only for comparability with the campaign's archive.

Phase split (PCS_TRACE, total ~833–839 ms): zc+lincheck 300, open 273,
commit 252, witgen/compact/claim-assembly ≈ 0. Three roughly equal
blocks; witness generation is genuinely free (PooledZeroed + aliased
compaction).

**What the kept optimizations are worth: −2.7%, 8/8.** Branch vs a
worktree at origin/main (8a36c91), PRODUCTION settings, blake3 pinned
on BOTH arms so the default-hash flip is not confounded, 8 alternating
pairs in a charging, quiet window:

| | best | median |
|---|---|---|
| branch | 894.5 ms | 904.4 ms |
| origin/main | 918.4 ms | 940.0 ms |

median Δ −25.3 ms, median ratio 0.9729, **8/8 branch**; best-vs-best
894.5 vs 918.4 = 1.027×. Throughput 293.1k vs 285.4k c/s. Per-pair Δ:
−17 −37 −21 −44 −20 −45 −15 −30 (arm order alternating; no order bias).

This supersedes the midday phase table (−3.6% MT / −4.8% ST, measured
at 19% battery under foreign load) and agrees with it in sign and rough
magnitude. Attribution is unchanged: essentially all of it is the
lincheck NEON block kernel (zc+lincheck −12% MT / −11% ST), with
commit and open at parity.

**Perspective.** The campaign's headline was 1.59× MT on the OLD
protocol (723.9 → 454.7 ms). After the main merge, the surviving,
still-live wins are worth 1.027×. The rest died structurally, each
verified this session: direct open (f256 split replaced the basis
open), stripe-C (batch-major layout), AB hoist (no GPU to free the
cores), compact-K/cascade (sparse wins on RS; AG already has the
hybrid), recursive fill fusion (wrong rate regime). That is the honest
accounting of the port campaign against today's protocol.

### RS vs AG, end to end — and a 3.2× dispatch bug in the AG path — 2026-08-31

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-01 — the sparse-route pathology below no longer
> reproduces.** Re-measured paired on the same machine and binary: AG
> sparse beats AG dense on EVERY stage (round1 55.65 vs 57.09, fold 41.06

Added `BLAKE3_ZC=rs|ag` to the blake3_proof bench (bench-only selector,
same family as BLAKE3_PROFILE / FLOCK_MERKLE_HASH). `prove_fast_union_ag`
is a true drop-in — same union commit, lincheck and merged opening,
only zerocheck round 1 differs — so this isolates the flavors on one
witness. Earlier AG numbers in this log came from `ag_breakdown`, which
drives the kernels on a DENSE synthetic witness and does NOT reflect the
union path; that comparison was invalid.

**AS SHIPPED, RS WINS BY 3.7×: RS 900 ms vs AG 3.37 s** at m=32.

Cause, from `[ag-zc-timing]`: the union's run-list makes AG take its
SPARSE route (out n = 48,234,496 = 71.875% — our occupancy), and the AG
sparse route is pathological:

| AG stage | sparse (default) | dense (gate raised) |
|---|---|---|
| round 1 | 147 ms | 55–69 ms |
| skip→mlv fold | 307 ms | 193 ms |
| mlv tail | **657 ms** | **120 ms** |

`FLOCK_SPARSE_GATE=999999999` (dense) takes the whole AG prove
**3.37 s → 1.04 s**. Paired, alternating, each flavor at its best
config: rs 943/966/889/910 vs ag-dense 886/873/896/900 — **AG wins 3/4,
median ≈ −34 ms (~4%)**. So AG is at parity-to-slightly-ahead of RS
*when dispatched correctly*, and 3.7× behind as shipped.

**MECHANISM:** the AG sparse tail forfeits the friendly-Horner kernel.
`fold_and_friendly_round_pair_into` (the γ-geometric kernel with no
per-term `eq_lo` PMULL) is called ONLY from the dense
`mlv_tail_fs_resume` (ag_skip.rs:1634-1640); `mlv_tail_fs_sparse`
routes through RS's `fold_and_round_pair_sparse_into` "with the
friendly constants riding as ordinary `r_next` weights" (:1412) — i.e.
the general kernel. The early rounds are the biggest, so losing the
friendly kernel there costs 5.5× on the tail.

**This is the `SPARSE_TAIL_GATE = 1` issue from this morning, now with
a price tag.** The constant makes the gate `live ≤ n` — always true —
contradicting its own doc ("Full utilization itself stays dense
(live·2 > n) ... the dense kernels are the calibrated choice there").
The asymmetry is measured, not assumed: at 71.875% occupancy sparse
WINS for RS (mech 89.3 vs 142.7 ms, 8/8) and LOSES catastrophically for
AG (tail 657 vs 120 ms). A global gate change would fix AG and cost RS
~53 ms, so the fix is a flavor-aware (or friendly-kernel-aware) gate,
not a new constant. NOT changed here — flagged for a decision, since AG
is main's direction of travel and this is the largest single effect
found all session.

### RS vs AG in their optimal configs — phase breakdown — 2026-08-31

RS at its optimum (default = sparse round2/tail, which RS wins 8/8) vs
AG at its optimum (dense route via FLOCK_SPARSE_GATE, since sparse costs
AG 3.2x). Both under identical PCS_TRACE + FLOCK_ZC_TIMING load, 4
alternating pairs, min-per-phase within each invocation, medians:

**ZEROCHECK — the only phase whose code differs. AG WINS.**

| stage | RS | AG |
|---|---|---|
| round 1 | 118.2 | **51.3** |
| round 2 / skip→mlv fold | **63.1** | 79.5 |
| tail | 92.9 | **83.9** |
| zerocheck subtotal | 274.2 | **214.6** |
| zc+lincheck bucket | 308.1 | **276.3** (0.897) |

**AG's round 1 is 2.3× cheaper (51.3 vs 118.2 ms)** — the genus-95
product-code round 1 vs the RS additive-NTT univariate skip. AG gives
some back on the fold (it materializes the full 2^26 folded pair where
RS's sparse round 2 does not) and is slightly ahead on the tail. Net
−60 ms of zerocheck. This part is mechanism-local and well outside
noise; it is the trustworthy half of this comparison.

**SHARED PHASES — identical code, so measured deltas are artifacts.**
commit +10.2 and open +27.6 for AG, but both arms run the same union
commit, lincheck and merged opening. Most plausible mechanism is
scratch-pool pressure: AG-dense holds a 2^26 F128 pair (~2 GB) where
RS-sparse holds 0.72× that. Worth measuring; NOT a code difference.

**END TO END — UNRESOLVED, do not quote a number.** Two runs disagree:
untraced 4 pairs had AG ahead ~34 ms (3/4); traced 4 pairs had AG
behind ~100 ms. Per-arm spread is ±100 ms, and the phase mins sum to
within 38 ms of RS's total but 132 ms of AG's (AG's per-prove variance
is higher, so min-of-phase and min-of-total come from different
proves). A follow-up 8-pair untraced run was ABORTED after two pairs:
absolute times had inflated to 1.07-1.40 s from 0.86 s, with WebKit at
38% CPU and WindowServer at 44% (load avg 4.6) — foreign interactive
load, the documented hazard. Battery was 98% charging, so not power.
Re-run on a quiet machine.

READING: AG is the better zerocheck, and the advantage is concentrated
entirely in round 1. Its liabilities are a larger materialized
intermediate and a currently catastrophic sparse route. Fixing the
dispatch is what makes AG's round-1 advantage reachable end to end.

### Statement-binding digest warmed at setup — first-prove latency −0.8 s — 2026-08-31

`union.bind_statement` absorbs `Registry::digest()`, which materializes
by BLAKE3-hashing every type's sparse A/B/C matrices (~21M nonzeros for
BLAKE3) — ~0.8–1.3 s, paid inside the FIRST prove and cached in a
`OnceLock` thereafter. The setup already warms the CSC fold circuit and
prefaults the scratch pool for exactly this reason, so the digest now
joins them (`blake3.rs`, `sha2.rs`: `let _ = registry.digest();`).

Verified: first-prove `bind statement` **1297 → 0.01 ms**, first-prove
TOTAL ~1.6–2.4 s → 843 ms. Pure cache-warm — the digest is a
deterministic function of the registry, so this only moves WHEN the
cache fills; suites green (core 560, prover 76) with all 13 proof pins
unchanged. Steady-state throughput is unaffected (the second and later
proves already hit the cache); this is first-proof latency only, which
matters for one-shot provers and for any measurement that averages
rather than takes a minimum.

### Single-threaded RS vs AG, both dispatch routes — 2026-08-31 (quiet machine)

`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`, m=32, 4 configs rotated over 2 rounds,
min-per-phase per invocation, medians (ms). Repeatability 0.34–1.23%
per config — the ST instrument the campaign always preferred:

| config | total | commit | zc+linc | open | r1 | r2/fold | tail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rs_sparse | 5081 | 1721 | 1570 | 1580 | 899 | 280 | 273 |
| rs_dense | 5383 | 1725 | 2004 | 1591 | 902 | 679 | 75 |
| **ag_sparse** | **4526** | 1712 | **1012** | 1598 | **364** | 244 | 276 |
| ag_dense | 4736 | 1716 | 1183 | 1597 | 365 | 266 | 421 |

1. **AG is 10.9% faster than RS at ST** (4526 vs 5081, 1.123×), and
   ALL of it is the zerocheck (1012 vs 1570 = −558 ms).
2. **AG round 1 is 2.5× cheaper** (364 vs 899) — matches the MT ratio
   (51 vs 118), so it is a kernel property, not a scheduling one.
3. **Sparse is optimal for BOTH flavors at ST** — RS 1570 vs 2004,
   AG 1012 vs 1183. This INVERTS the MT reading for AG (where sparse
   measured 3.2× worse end to end), so the sparse route's problem is a
   PARALLEL-scaling one, not a kernel-quality one.
4. commit (1712–1725) and open (1580–1598) are flat across all four
   configs — they are shared code, confirming the earlier MT
   "commit +10 / open +28" deltas were measurement artifacts.

CORRECTION to the RS-vs-AG entry above: the claim that AG's sparse
route "forfeits the friendly-Horner kernel" and pays 5.5× for it is NOT
supported. `mlv_tail_fs_sparse` runs sparse rounds and then expands
once and RESUMES the lookahead/friendly tail, so it forfeits the
friendly kernel only for the rounds it actually runs sparse — and at ST
its tail (276) still beats the all-dense tail (421). The earlier
per-phase MT attribution (tail 657 vs 120) was taken from the COLD
first prove (its `bind statement` read 1297 ms) and is withdrawn. The
warm MT phase table is the outstanding measurement.

### Round 2: vector-resident accumulator ported (§wideneon) — −9.2% ST, 3/3 — 2026-08-31

**The campaign's round-2 machinery was NOT live.** Main's shared round-2
kernel `fold_pair_run` (multilinear.rs) accumulates the 256-bit message
partials in `F256Unreduced` — the four-word GPR struct that §wideneon
replaced — so every `mul_unreduced` pays six `vgetq_lane_u64` extracts
to leave the vector file and every `^=` is four GPR XORs. Notably main's
**x86 arm already accumulates wide** (`WideGhashX4`); only aarch64 was
left on the scalar struct. `WideNeon` was sitting in
`field/gf2_128/aarch64.rs` — with a doc comment describing this exact
optimization — reachable only from the dormant compact-K block.

Ported: the aarch64 arm of `fold_pair_run` now accumulates into two
`WideNeon` vector registers via `wide_mul_unreduced_neon`, flushing to
`F256Unreduced` once per run. Both round-2 routes (interval/sparse at
:966 and dense at :996) call `fold_pair_run`, so both get it. Bit-
identical: reduction is XOR-linear and the XOR multiset is unchanged;
all 13 proof pins hold, suites green (core 560, prover 76).

**ST paired A/B vs 8bd1a27, 3 alternating pairs (m=32, quiet machine):**

| phase | cand | ctrl | delta | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **round 2** | **239.3** | **281.7** | **−26.0 (−9.2%)** | **3/3** |
| round 1 | 900.5 | 899.3 | +0.5 | control, flat |
| tail | 273.2 | 275.6 | −2.4 | control, flat |
| zc+lincheck | 1544.6 | 1580.5 | −46.3 | 2/3 |
| commit | 1720.1 | 1729.8 | −9.8 | control, noise |
| total | 4928.9 | 4986.8 | −50.2 | 2/3 |

Round 2 is 3/3 disjoint at −26 ms; round 1 and the tail are flat, which
is the correct control signature (the change touches only round 2's
accumulator). The tex measured −13.4% for this on the old tree; we get
−9.2%, on a baseline that is already cheaper because main's sparse path
folds ~72% of the domain.

Round 2 ST: **281.7 → 239.3 ms** — versus the campaign's 312 ms best on
the old protocol. §qres (the register-resident message loop, a further
−13% there) is the untouched second half of that section: the loop still
computes `g1 = a1 * b1` as a REDUCED scalar multiply before the unreduced
eq product, which is exactly the register-file crossing §qres removed.

### Why the commit bucket is noisy: it is the lane transpose fill — 2026-08-31

Per-prove ST commit sub-timings (new `scan+take` / `lane fill` line under
the existing FLOCK_COMMIT_TIMING knob):

| prove | scan+take | lane fill | ntt | merkle | commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.00 | 109.5 | ~644 | ~960 | 1720.4 |
| 2 | 0.00 | 117.8 | ~636 | ~950 | 1740.6 |
| 3 | 0.01 | **159.6** | ~646 | ~974 | 1766.5 |
| 4 | 0.01 | **153.5** | ~637 | ~970 | 1767.2 |
| 5 | 0.01 | 118.4 | ~644 | ~957 | 1732.7 |

NTT varies 1.7%, merkle 2.5%, **the fill varies 46% (109–160 ms)** — and
that accounts for essentially all of the commit bucket's ±34 ms swing.
The allocation itself is free (0.00–0.01 ms: the scratch pool returns a
warm buffer, so `prewarm_prover` is working).

MECHANISM: `replicate_lane_major_fill` is the transpose
`out[p·t + lane] = q[lane·d + p]`. It tiles over 64 positions but NOT
over lanes, so it keeps **t concurrent read streams** open — one per
lane, each walking a far-apart region of a 2 GB buffer — while writing
with stride `t` elements. That is TLB/page-mapping bound, and page
placement varies per process and per pool recycle: stable work, variable
time. The NTT and Merkle are sequential streams over the same bytes and
do not show it.

**Methodological consequence: commit deltas below ~40 ms are not
trustworthy on this host.** This retroactively explains the phantom
"commit +10 / open +28" in the RS-vs-AG table (identical code both arms)
and the ±34 commit swings in the round-2 A/B, where round 1 — a
compute-bound phase — was flat to 0.2% in the same runs. Prefer
compute-bound phases as controls.

OPEN OPTIMIZATION: block the fill over lanes (e.g. 8 at a time) so the
number of live read streams is bounded. Should cut both the mean and the
variance of a 109–160 ms ST pass. Not attempted yet.

### Lane-fill tiling: 1 KiB read bursts were starving the prefetcher — 2026-08-31

Follow-up to the noise finding above. `replicate_lane_major_fill` tiled
at 64 positions, and the tile length IS the per-lane read burst: 64
F128 = 1 KiB, with `t` lanes whose source regions sit `d` elements
(8 MiB at m=32) apart. The prefetcher never establishes a stream across
61 far-separated 1 KiB bursts, so a pure copy ran at ~9 GB/s.

Tile sweep, m=32, median of 5 proves per setting:

| positions/tile | ST fill | MT fill |
|---|---|---|
| 64 (was) | 136 ms | ~31 ms |
| 256 | 106 | ~32 |
| **1024** | **94** | ~31 |
| 4096 | 100 | — |
| 2048 | — | ~30 |

**ST −31%; MT is a wash** — at 8 workers the pass is bandwidth-saturated
regardless of burst length, so this is an ST/low-thread win taken at
zero MT cost. Shipped as a size-aware tile rather than a constant:
`tile = (d / (4 * threads)).clamp(64, 1024)`, keeping ≥4 tiles per
worker so small commits do not collapse to a single task. Verified after:
ST fill median 136 → 103, min 124 → 63. Suites green (pure loop
retiling; the commit byte-identity tests cover it).

NOTE — this does NOT fix the commit bucket's variance. The residual
spread is the same at every tile size (MT 16→35 ms within one process,
ST 63→108), and it tracks prove ORDER, not geometry: the first proves
of a process are consistently fastest. That points at scratch-pool /
page state (the first proves get `prewarm_prover`'s prefaulted buffers,
later ones get recycled ones), which is a separate lead. The
"commit deltas under ~40 ms are untrustworthy" rule stands.

### Round 2: the register-resident message loop (§qres) — −11.6% ST, 3/3 — 2026-08-31

Second half of the tex's round-2 section, on top of §wideneon. All three
per-pair vector/GPR crossings it targets were still present after the
accumulator port: (1) `fold_one_row_neon_unchecked_8` extracted its
vector accumulator to an `F128` GPR struct, (2) `g1 = a1 * b1` went
through the scalar field multiply struct-in/struct-out, (3)
`wide_mul_unreduced_neon` re-entered the vector file.

Every q-resident primitive was ALREADY in the tree, reachable only from
the dormant compact-K block — `mul_q`, `wide_mul_unreduced_q`, and
`fold_one_row_neon_q_unchecked_8`, whose own doc says it exists "for
callers that keep computing on it (the round-2 message chain)". The
chain now runs fold → `mul_q` → `wide_mul_unreduced_q` → `WideNeon`
with nothing leaving the vector file; per pair the only traffic left is
the four required folded-value stores (`vst1q_u64`) and one eq load.

Bit-identical: `F128` is `repr(C, align(16)) {lo, hi}` and the
extraction convention is lane0→lo, lane1→hi, so the vector stores write
the same bytes; reduction stays XOR-linear. 13 proof pins unchanged.

**ST paired A/B vs c9c4533, 3 alternating pairs:**

| phase | cand | ctrl | delta | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **round 2** | **236.1** | **267.2** | **−31.0 (−11.6%)** | **3/3** |
| round 1 | 897.3 | 898.4 | −0.0 | control, flat |
| tail | 274.1 | 277.8 | −4.4 | control |
| zc+lincheck | 1537.2 | 1572.8 | −35.4 | 3/3 |
| commit | 1667.7 | 1677.3 | −9.9 | (under the ~40 ms noise floor) |

Matches the tex's −13.0% for this section closely.

**Round 2 cumulative today: 281.7 → 236.1 ms ST (−16.2%)** across
§wideneon (−9.2%, 3/3) and §qres (−11.6%, 3/3), against the campaign's
312 ms best on the old protocol.

ALSO FIXED: §wideneon (da4e4b8) referenced `gf2_128::aarch64` — which is
gated on `target_feature = "aes"` — from a block gated only on
`target_arch = "aarch64"`. That compiles on `aarch64-apple-darwin`
(aes is default) but would break a non-aes aarch64 build. Both arms are
now correctly gated, with the extracted-fold path kept as the non-PMULL
fallback.

### AG skip fold: the byte-dot was the scalar twin of an existing NEON kernel — −9% ST, −7.5% MT — 2026-08-31

Targeted by evidence, not by analogy. The earlier probes put the AG
fold's cost at ~85% byte-dot gathers and only ~12% message chain
(removing the Horner + products entirely saved 4–6 ms of 42), so the
§wideneon/§qres treatment that paid in RS round 2 does NOT apply here —
the accumulator is not where the time is. The gather is.

`byte_dot_u64` folds one 64-bit message through `8 x [F128; 256]` tables:
eight gathers XORed. That is *exactly* what RS's
`fold_one_row_neon_q_unchecked_8` does, with the identical table layout
(contiguous, `STRIDE = 256*16`) — but AG's was written scalar
(`*table.get_unchecked(j).get_unchecked(byte)` + `F128 +`) while RS's is
NEON. Re-exported the RS kernel from `multilinear` as `fold_row_q_neon`
and routed AG's `byte_dot` through it on aarch64; the scalar form stays
as the non-aarch64 path.

Paired A/B (min-of-proves per invocation, alternating), m=32:

| | NEON | scalar | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| MT pair 1 | 37.99 | 41.12 | −3.13 |
| MT pair 2 | 40.84 | 41.78 | −0.94 |
| MT pair 3 | 40.47 | 44.50 | −4.03 |
| **MT median** | | | **−3.1 (−7.5%), 3/3** |
| ST pair 1 | 278.22 | 305.16 | −26.9 |
| ST pair 2 | 280.03 | 309.26 | −29.2 |
| **ST** | | | **−28 (−9.0%), 2/2** |

Bit-identical (same table entries, same XOR multiset): core 560 green,
prover 76 green, and the heavy `prove_fast_union_ag_roundtrip` verifies.

Smaller than hoped — LLVM was already emitting reasonable code for the
16-byte-aligned `F128` table loads, so this recovers the remaining gap
rather than a 2×. But it is the first improvement to the AG path, and it
lands on AG's second-largest phase.

### Measurement loop: 20 min → ~22 s (benchmarks/abq.sh) — 2026-08-31

Timed the actual costs instead of assuming them. Corrections to how this
session was working:

| step | cost |
|---|---|
| full m=32 prove, **MT**, one invocation (5 proves + setup) | **6.9 s** |
| same at **ST** | ~30 s |
| `round2` micro-bench, whole m=16..29 sweep | **0.6 s** |
| rebuild after touching a flock-core kernel (release) | **20.7 s** |
| same build under `[profile.bench]` (lto=thin, cgu=1) | 54.3 s |

So a 3-pair MT full-prove A/B is only ~41 s — my 10-20 minute A/Bs were
all **ST**, where each prove is ~5 s. And once MT is used, **the BUILD is
the dominant cost**, comparable to an entire A/B.

Consequences, now encoded in `benchmarks/abq.sh`:
- **Kernel work goes through the micro-benches**, which drive the same
  kernels on a synthetic witness with no R1CS build, commit or open —
  and most print a CHECKSUM, so bit-identity is proven for free instead
  of by a 4-minute test suite. Validated: the round-2 ports measured
  −16.2% on the full ST prove and **−19.5% here (3/3, checksums
  identical) in 2 seconds**.
- **Iterate under the RELEASE profile, not `cargo bench`'s.** The
  workspace `[profile.bench]` (lto="thin", codegen-units=1) costs 54 s
  vs 20 s and measured the SAME number on this kernel (54.11 vs
  53.7-55.5 ms at m=29 ST). Re-measure under `cargo bench` only for a
  published headline.
- **Prefer MT for A/B, ST for certification.** ST is 4x more repeatable
  (0.3-1.2%) but 4x slower per invocation.
- **Explore parameters with a temporary runtime knob** (one build, many
  configs — as the FLOCK_FILL_TILE sweep did), and remove it before
  commit. That is the only way to get the 20 s build out of the loop.
- abq.sh builds both arms concurrently and takes the FIRST matching
  metric line inside an optional `-m <size>` section — grepping a whole
  sweep and taking the min silently measures the smallest size.

Usage: `benchmarks/abq.sh -b round2 -c <control-worktree> -m 29
[-p 3] [-e "RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1"] [-a "32 3"] [-g "(best)"]`

### More round-2 / AG-fold ILP: one marginal win, one regression — 2026-09-01

Both loops are now gather-bound (32 table gathers per pair / per inner
step), so the lever left is how many independent gather chains are in
flight — the §twolane idea. Tried on both, using the new abq harness
(each verdict took ~2 minutes rather than ~20).

**Round 2, two pairs per iteration: −4.9% MT / −2.5% ST, 3/3, checksums
identical.** Mechanism is loads-before-stores: with one pair the
compiler cannot hoist the next iteration's gathers past the output
stores, so eight chains only overlap if two pairs are folded before
either is stored.
**NOT KEPT — below the bloat bar.** 79 insertions for ~−2 ms MT
(round 2 is ~43 ms of a ~900 ms prove, so 0.23% end to end). The log's
own precedent rejected epool-zc at "−6..7 ms, ~200 lines"; this is a
worse ratio. Patch preserved at
`scratchpad/round2_2pair_unroll.patch` — restore with `git apply` if
the bar ever moves.

**AG fold, two inner steps per iteration: +15%, 0/3 — REGRESSION.**
Same transformation, opposite sign. The AG fold writes into per-block
128-element `am`/`bm` slices that are L1-resident, so its stores never
blocked hoisting in the first place; doubling the live values (8 F128 +
2 F256Unreduced) buys nothing and costs register pressure against a
strictly serial γ²-Horner chain. Reverted.

Worth recording as a rule: **round 2 and the AG fold look structurally
identical — 32 gathers, four byte-dots, a wide accumulator — and
respond OPPOSITELY to the same restructuring.** The difference is the
output: round 2 streams into a large codeword-sized buffer, the AG fold
into a small L1-resident block.

Remaining untested lever for both: 16-bit gather indices (4 gathers per
row fold instead of 8, from 4 x 65536-entry tables = 4 MiB). The
campaign's performance model says "gather count and chain depth bind,
table footprint under L1 is irrelevant" — but 4 MiB is far past L1, and
the campaign already measured an 8x-smaller table as a −3.6%
regression, so the sign is genuinely unknown. Cheap to settle with abq
if anyone wants it.

### CORRECTION: the AG-fold "+15% regression" was a cold-prove artifact — 2026-09-01

The entry above reports the AG fold's two-step unroll as +15%, 0/3. **That
number is wrong and is withdrawn.** `abq.sh` was taking the FIRST matching
metric line, which for `ag_breakdown` is the COLD first prove (18.3 ms
against a ~10 ms warm min), so both arms were cold and the comparison was
noise. Round 2 was unaffected — its `(best)` line is already a min — which
is why that result stands.

Re-measured warm, same binary switched by a temporary knob, alternating:

| pair | unroll | plain |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 9.87 | 9.96 |
| 2 | 9.94 | 10.05 |
| 3 | 10.03 | 10.00 |

**AG fold unroll is NEUTRAL (−0.9%, 2/3), not a regression.**

Crossing the unroll against the Horner (one build, four configs) also
shows no large effect: horner-on 10.04 vs 9.90, horner-off 8.83 vs 8.94
— a ~2% swing either way, inside noise at single-shot resolution.

So the real contrast is narrower than claimed: **round 2 gains ~5% MT
from unrolling; the AG fold gains nothing.** The store destination
remains the best explanation — round 2 streams into a codeword-sized
buffer whose stores block the compiler from hoisting the next
iteration's gathers, so folding two pairs before storing either exposes
eight chains; the AG fold writes into 128-element `am`/`bm` slices that
stay in L1, where the compiler could already interleave, so there is
nothing left to expose. The earlier "register pressure against a serial
Horner" story is NOT needed to explain a null.

`abq.sh` now takes the MIN over matching lines inside the `-m` section
(section bounded by the next `===` banner), with both traps documented
in its header.

### Round-2 unroll: NOT APPLIED — it is dense-only, and production is sparse — 2026-09-01

Benedikt's call was that ~5% of a phase clears the bloat bar, so the
two-pair unroll was re-applied and re-verified. It does not survive the
production check:

| measurement | result |
|---|---|
| `round2` micro-bench (DENSE padding), MT | −3.5%, 3/3 |
| `round2` micro-bench (DENSE padding), ST | −2.3%, 3/3 |
| **real prove, m=32 MT (SPARSE route)** | **+1.4 ms, 1/3** |
| **real prove, m=32 ST (SPARSE route)** | **+16 ms = +6.8%, 0/3** |

ST real-prove pairs: 255.0/252.2/251.9 (unrolled) vs 240.7/236.4/234.9
(plain). Reverted — this is a REGRESSION where it matters, not a
bloat-bar rejection.

WHY: production at m=32 takes the sparse round-2 route, which calls
`fold_pair_run` per live INTERVAL PIECE — short ranges writing into
small, L1-resident output slices. That is the same regime as the AG
fold, where the unroll also bought nothing: when the stores are already
cache-resident the compiler can interleave across iterations anyway, so
the restructure adds control flow (two closures, a mixed-liveness
branch, a tail loop) for no scheduling gain. The dense route writes into
a codeword-sized buffer where the stores DO block hoisting, which is the
only regime the unroll helps.

**METHODOLOGICAL LESSON, the second self-inflicted one today: the
zerocheck micro-benches drive DENSE padding and are NOT a proxy for the
production sparse dispatch.** They were validated against §wideneon and
§qres (−19.5% micro vs −16.2% real) only because those changes help both
routes equally — they touch the per-pair arithmetic, not the loop
structure. Any change to LOOP STRUCTURE or dispatch must be confirmed on
the real prove. This caveat was written into abq.sh's introduction and
then ignored one experiment later. abq.sh header updated to say it
outright.

The two round-2 ports that DID land (§wideneon, §qres, 281.7 → 236.1 ms
ST cumulative) were measured on the real prove throughout, so they are
unaffected by this.

### CORRECTION 2: the round-2 unroll is NEUTRAL on production, not a regression — 2026-09-01

Benedikt pushed back that a kernel cannot be faster in isolation and
slower in situ without something differing in how it is CALLED. He was
right, and both of my explanations were wrong.

First theory (short interval pieces) — **false**. Probed the actual
argument: the sparse route calls `fold_pair_run` with pieces of 4096,
3584, 3072, 2560, 2048, 1536, 1024 and 512 pairs. Long ranges; per-call
overhead is not it.

Second, the "+6.8% ST regression" itself — **an artifact of comparing
two separately built BINARIES.** Re-measured with the unroll behind a
runtime knob so ONE binary provides both arms, real prove, m=32 ST,
7 alternating pairs: +11.7, −2.4, −1.7, +0.3, −1.4, +0.3, −4.9 →
**median −1.4 ms (−0.6%), 4/7 — neutral.** The two-binary run's +16 ms
was code layout/alignment, which at this effect size dominates: the
control worktree was also three commits behind, so the binaries differed
in more than the change.

Corrected picture:

| route | effect |
|---|---|
| dense (micro-bench) | −3.5% MT, −2.3% ST, 3/3 — real |
| **sparse (production m=32)** | **neutral, −0.6%, 4/7** |

So it is a genuine win on the DENSE round-2 route and buys nothing on
the route production currently takes. Left unapplied (patch preserved in
`scratchpad/round2_2pair_unroll.patch`), but note the coupling: **if the
`SPARSE_TAIL_GATE` question is ever resolved toward dense dispatch, this
becomes a live ~3% win** and should be revisited with it.

**THIRD measurement error today, all one family:** cold-vs-warm proves,
dense-vs-sparse routes, and now binary-vs-binary layout. Each time the
two arms differed in more ways than the change. Rule going forward, and
the one that actually settled this: **for effects under ~5%, switch the
variant with a temporary runtime knob inside ONE binary.** Cross-binary
A/B is only trustworthy for larger effects or when the trees differ by
exactly the change.

### Sparse vs dense in round 2 — the "sparse r2 + cascade tail" hybrid is REFUTED — 2026-09-01

Benedikt asked why the micro-benches drive DENSE padding when production
runs SPARSE, and whether round 2 should be dense at all. Both parts have
answers, and the second one overturns this session's earlier claim.

**Why the micro-benches are dense:** they predate the union/sparse work
and call the dense entry point. That is a genuine tooling gap — it is why
the two-pair unroll looked like a win. They remain valid for per-pair
ARITHMETIC changes (wideneon/qres read −19.5% there vs −16.2% real), but
not for anything touching dispatch or loop structure.

**Should round 2 be dense? No.** Sparse round 2 costs 240 ms ST against
the compact-K producer's 679 ms; it folds ~72% of the domain and wins
outright.

**And the hybrid this log proposed on 2026-08-31 — "sparse round 2
handing off to the cascade tail, the win neither tree has" — is WRONG.**
The claim rested on comparing the sparse tail (273 ms) with the dense
route's cascade tail (75 ms). Those are not comparable: the dense route's
tail starts at a QUARTER of the domain, because compact-K has already
consumed rounds 2–5. Its cheap tail is bought by its expensive producer.

Measured directly, one binary, temporary `FLOCK_ZC_TAILPOLICY` knob,
real prove m=32 ST:

| policy | round 2 | tail | zc+lincheck |
|---|---|---|---|
| sparse tail (today) | 240.6 | **277.3** | **1564.8** |
| expand + cascade tail | 238.0 | **577.6** | 1855.2 |

The hybrid is **2x WORSE on the tail**: it pays `expand_to_dense` at the
largest size and then runs every tail round over the full domain instead
of the 72% live span, and the cascade's pass-halving does not cover
either cost. Reverted.

CONCLUSION: **the current dispatch — sparse round 2, sparse tail — is
correct**, and the zerocheck's route selection is not the open
opportunity this log claimed it was. Both the "sparse 4→1 lookahead
kernel neither tree has" item and the sparse-vs-cascade hybrid are
closed. (The separate `SPARSE_TAIL_GATE` question for the AG path stands
on its own evidence and is unaffected.)

### Micro-benches fixed: they now drive the PRODUCTION sparse dispatch — 2026-09-01

The zerocheck micro-benches predate the union/sparse work and measured a
route the m=32 prove never takes. That gap produced a wrong verdict
(a two-pair unroll read −3.5% on the dense bench and neutral on the real
prove), so the benches are now shaped like the shipped witness.

`benches/round2.rs` — rewritten to call
`uni_skip_fold_and_round_pair_runs_sparse` under a run-list
`PaddingSpec` matching the BLAKE3 union (`useful_bits = 11_707` of a
2^14 block ⇒ `ceil(11707/128) = 92` useful chunk-columns of 128 =
71.875% occupancy), with the dead column tail left honestly zero as the
prover guarantees. **The dense entry is gone.** m starts at 20 because
the block skip needs `k_log = m − 7 ≥ 13`.

`benches/round1.rs` — the two-bank fusion variant now takes the same
run-list instead of `PaddingSpec::dense(m)`.

VALIDATED against the two things whose truth we already know from the
real prove:

| change | old DENSE bench | **new SPARSE bench** | real prove |
|---|---|---|---|
| §wideneon + §qres | −19.5% | **−13.1%, 3/3** | −16.2% |
| two-pair unroll | −3.5%, 3/3 | **+0.24 ms, 1/3** | neutral, 4/7 |

So it now both detects the real win and REJECTS the false positive that
motivated the fix. Checksums identical in both cases.

Note for future A/Bs: changing a bench's source means the control
worktree must get the SAME bench file, or the two arms run different
instruments — which shows up immediately as differing checksums (it did,
because `cp` is aliased interactive and silently did not overwrite).

STILL DENSE-ONLY: `rounds3plus.rs` benches
`fold_and_compute_round_pair_optimized` and never the sparse tail
(`fold_and_round_pair_sparse_into`), so tail work still needs a real
prove to adjudicate. Fixing it needs a `LiveLayout` fixture, not just a
padding spec.

### 16-bit gather tables: REFUTED, −21..25% — 2026-09-01

The last untested lever on the round-2 fold: index the row fold with
16-bit chunks instead of bytes — 4 gathers per row from `4 x 65536`
entries (4 MiB) instead of 8 gathers from `8 x 256` (32 KiB). Built
`T16[j][v] = data[2j][v & 0xff] + data[2j+1][v >> 8]` (same XOR multiset,
so the fold is value-identical) plus a `fold_one_row_neon_q_unchecked_4x16`
kernel, selected by a runtime knob so ONE binary measured both.

Measured on the fixed SPARSE round-2 bench, m=29:

| | 8-bit (8 gathers, 32 KiB) | 16-bit (4 gathers, 4 MiB) |
|---|---|---|
| ST | **35.42 ms** | 44.21 ms (+25%) |
| MT | **6.59 ms** | 7.98 ms (+21%) |

Checksums identical, so the table construction is right; it is simply
slower. Halving the gather COUNT does not pay for leaving L1: 4 MiB sits
in (shared) L2, and the added latency per gather more than eats the four
saved. Building the table also costs 0.08 → 0.63 ms per prove.

**Model correction.** The campaign's rule — "table footprint under
128 KiB L1D is irrelevant; gather count and chain depth are what bind" —
holds only WITHIN L1. Past L1 the footprint dominates and the rule
inverts. That is consistent with the campaign's own earlier datum that an
8x-SMALLER table also regressed 3.6%: the current 32 KiB, 8-gather shape
is a local optimum in both directions.

Reverted. With this closed, round 2's fold has no untested lever left
that this session can identify: the arithmetic is q-resident
(§wideneon + §qres, −16.2% ST on the real prove), the loop structure is
right for the sparse route, and the table geometry is optimal in both
directions.

### Round 1: §pmull is already live (RS); its AG analog (Karatsuba accumulate) REFUTED — 2026-09-01

**RS round 1 already has §pmull.** The x^4-scaled gather table and the
x^2 byte-doubling are in `univariate_skip_optimized/kernels/aarch64.rs`
(:595, :635) — the multiplicative weight splitting survived the merge.
Nothing to port.

**The idea does not map to AG round 1 as written.** §pmull defers a
per-product REDUCTION in F_{2^8}; AG round 1 has none to defer. Its
products are bitsliced F_2 (`pr = (af&bx) ^ (ax&bf)` — AND/XOR, free),
and its eq-weighting already accumulates unreduced into
`UnredAcc = [ll, cross, hh]`. The "unreduced accumulation" half is
therefore already present; there is no structured weight `x^K` to split,
because the weight is one general `eq_o` per block.

**What the same family did suggest, and it failed.** AG's accumulate is
SCHOOLBOOK — 4 PMULL. Karatsuba forms the middle as
`(eq.lo^eq.hi)·(xl^xh) = cross ^ ll ^ hh`, and since `ll`/`hh` are
accumulated in their own lanes the correction defers to `reduce_unred`
by linearity — structurally the same deferral §pmull uses. 3 PMULL, with
`eq.lo^eq.hi` hoisting (eq is per-block constant).

Value-identical (genus95 tests pass under both settings; the AG union
roundtrip VERIFIES a real proof under Karatsuba). Measured on the REAL
AG prove — `BLAKE3_ZC=ag`, the padded/coverage kernel, not
`ag_breakdown` — ST, one binary, knob-switched, alternating:

| pair | karatsuba | schoolbook | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 646.22 | 639.72 | +6.50 |
| 2 | 644.60 | 639.75 | +4.85 |
| 3 | 644.55 | 633.56 | +10.99 |

**0/3, ~+1%. Reverted.** Third independent refutation of Karatsuba on
this core (the campaign's NTT butterfly was +58%): trading one PMULL for
two extra XORs and a longer dependency chain does not pay when PMULL
throughput is not the binding constraint. The M1 model's
"re-encoding fixed work never pays" rule now stands at 0/7.

ALSO: `benches/ag_breakdown.rs` drives the DENSE
`round1_slp_packed_banks_fused`, not the `_padded` coverage kernel
production uses — the same dense-only flaw fixed in round1/round2. Any
AG round-1 work must be measured on the real prove until that is fixed.

### Round-1 optimizations, one by one, against AG — 2026-09-01

`ag_breakdown` fixed first (87b88a5) so all of this is measured on the
padded/sparse kernels production calls. m=30 production shape: round-1
12.27 / fold 16.24 / tail 13.18 ms.

**§pmull (unreduced accumulation + multiplicative weight splitting).**
Already LIVE in RS round 1 (x^4-scaled gather table + x^2 doubling,
`univariate_skip_optimized/kernels/aarch64.rs:595,635`). Does not map to
AG: it defers an F_{2^8} product reduction, and AG has none — its
products are bitsliced F_2 AND/XOR and its eq-weighting already
accumulates unreduced. Nearest analog (Karatsuba, 4→3 PMULL, cross
correction deferred to `reduce_unred` by linearity) measured **0/3, ~+1%
on the real AG prove** — reverted, third Karatsuba refutation on this
core.

**§twolane (ILP in the gather drain). NOT APPLICABLE.** Its premise is
that one lane exposes only THREE dependency chains, so processing two
lanes doubles them to six. AG's `product_fold_bs` accumulates into 160
independent `res[p]` accumulators plus 128 C banks — 160+ chains are
already in flight, and there is no gather-table drain at all. The
optimization has nothing to widen.

**§zeroskip (structurally fixed b rows). ALREADY REALIZED.** It guards
rows where `b = 0` because `T(0) = 0`. Our own census (2026-08-31) found
B_0 has exactly **4677 empty rows = K − USEFUL_BITS = 16384 − 11707** —
i.e. every structurally-zero b row in this circuit IS the padding tail,
which `BlockCoverage::Dead` already skips wholesale before any kernel
runs. Inside live blocks there are no zero b rows left to guard.

**§structuredb (all-ones b shortcut). UNDER THE BAR.** The constant rows
in our useful region are constant-ONE (1409 rows, 11 whole 128-bit
planes = 12% of the ~92 useful planes), not zero. Two independent
reasons to expect little: the ceiling is 12% of the b-encode, a
sub-phase of a 12 ms phase; and the tex itself records that
constant-folding all-ones rows in RS "returns 6 ms where 27 were
predicted", because halving a row's loads halves its memory-level
parallelism — "whole-row elimination is what pays", and whole rows are
already gone via coverage.

An attempt to upper-bound the b-encode empirically (skip it entirely,
measure the ceiling) was **contaminated and is not reported**: the
`LazyLock` guard sits in the per-block hot path, and removing the encode
measured SLOWER (19.6 vs 12.2 ms) — the same guard-in-the-loop artifact
seen in the AG fold store probe. A valid version needs a const-generic
or a second binary; not pursued, since the census already bounds the
prize below the bar.

VERDICT: all four round-1 optimizations are accounted for — one live,
one refuted by measurement, one inapplicable by structure, one already
realized by the coverage mechanism, and the residual under the bar. AG
round 1 has no untested lever left from the tex.

### Structured-b for AG, measured cleanly: ceiling is 2% of round 1 — 2026-09-01

Re-ran the b-encode ceiling probe without the contamination. The fix was
to make the skip a **const generic** (`process_block_fused<const SKIP_B:
bool>`, with the two public entries resolving the flag ONCE and
dispatching to a monomorphised inner fn), so the hot path sees a
compile-time constant instead of a `LazyLock` deref per block.

Validation that it is clean: baseline reads 12.33 / 12.68 / 12.66 ms,
matching the UNMODIFIED kernel's 12.2-12.3 — the earlier version moved
the baseline and inverted the result.

| | AG round 1, m=30, production shape |
|---|---|
| baseline | 12.66 ms |
| b-encode removed entirely | 10.55 ms |
| **whole b-encode** | **2.11 ms = 16.7% of round 1** |

So even deleting 100% of the b-operand encode buys 16.7% of round 1.
Structured-b targets the structurally-constant planes only — our census
puts that at 11 of ~92 useful planes (12%) — so its **ceiling is
0.25 ms, 2.0% of round 1**, which is ~0.6% of the AG zerocheck and under
0.1% end to end. And that is a ceiling: a real implementation cannot
skip individual input planes of `encode_slp_derived` (a straight-line
program mixing all 64), so it would require regenerating a reduced SLP
plus hoisting the constant planes' contribution — a code-generation job
for at most a quarter of a millisecond.

**Structured-b for AG is dead, now by measurement rather than by
analogy.** With it, every round-1 optimization in the tex is closed
against AG.

TECHNIQUE WORTH KEEPING: to probe a hot path by removing work, resolve
the switch OUTSIDE the loop and monomorphise (const generic), then
verify the baseline arm still reproduces the unmodified timing before
believing the other arm. Two probes today were wrecked by a flag read
inside the loop.

### §stripe (C-side from the lincheck stripe): RS blocked, AG unbuilt but PRICED — 2026-09-01

**RS: blocked, measured.** Wiring `round1_..._stripe_c` on the union path
fails with `Zerocheck(SumcheckFinalFailed)` — the union commits
BatchMajor while the stripe fold assumes the RowMajor stripe↔witness
index relation (the challenge tree gates the same mechanism on
`layout == RowMajor`). Recorded 2026-08-31; unchanged.

**AG: the mechanism does not exist and would need fresh derivation, so
price it first.** AG's C side is a per-block bit transpose
(`bitslice_block_into` / `transpose_fold_c_banks_2src`) plus 128
`mul_acc_unred` into the even/odd friendly-bit banks — structurally the
same thing §stripe deletes in RS ("removes the per-window bit transpose
entirely; the drain's gathers drop from three to one").

Priced with the const-generic probe (baseline reproduces the unmodified
kernel at 12.29/12.32/12.49 ms, so this one is clean):

| AG round 1, m=30 MT, production shape | |
|---|---|
| baseline | 12.32 ms |
| C side removed entirely | 9.73 ms |
| **whole C side** | **2.59 ms = 21.0% of round 1** |

So the ceiling is 21% of round 1 — ~10 ms MT at m=32, where AG round 1
is ~50 ms. RS's own §stripe captured −5.7% of its round 1 against a
comparable share, i.e. roughly a quarter of its C side, since the stripe
fold is not free either. Scaling that ratio suggests **~2-5 ms MT at
m=32, ~1-3% of the AG zerocheck**.

VERDICT: the only round-1 item with a non-trivial prize left, but it is
NEW MATH, not a port — the AG C banks are over genus-95 code coordinates
with the even/odd friendly split, and the derivation would have to
target BatchMajor (the layout that killed the RS port) from the start.
Not attempted; recorded with its price so the decision is informed.

### §stripe re-derived for AG: the math works, the economics do not — 2026-09-01

Derived rather than ported, since the RS implementation is RowMajor-bound.

**THE DERIVATION (correct, recorded for reuse).** Batch-major addresses
are `[7 in-word | n_log batch | k_log-7 chunk]`; AG splits the same
address as `[skip(6) | inner(7) | outer]`. So

- AG skip (bits 0-5) = in-word bits 0-5
- AG parity = inner dim 0 (bit 6) = in-word bit 6
- AG inner dims 1-6 (bits 7-12) = **batch** bits 0-5
- AG outer (bits 13+) = remaining batch bits AND all chunk bits

With `pf = Σ_i x^i·bit_i` split by parity of `i`, the banks are

    bank_p[k] = Σ_o eq_o · Σ_{i ≡ p (2)} x^i · z[o·128 + i, k]

`x^i = Π_j (x^{2^j})^{i_j}` is a product of per-dim factors and `eq_o` is
an eq tensor, so **W is rank-1 over every folded dimension** — the
condition for a per-dim fold. Keep in-word bits 0-6 unfolded (128
values); then `bank_0[k] = v[k]` and `bank_1[k] = x · v[64+k]`. The extra
`x` on the odd bank is independently confirmed by the existing
`banks_to_message`, which applies `gamma_inv` to bank1 "because the
kernel's odd-i bank carries an extra γ from friendly bit 0".

**BatchMajor is NOT the blocker here** — that only killed the RS port
because that code assumes a fixed RowMajor index relation. Deriving
fresh, the sole consequence is that AG's friendly dims 1-6 sit in the
INSTANCE index rather than the row index, so the outer fold carries
`eq ⊗ friendly` instead of pure `eq`. Still rank-1, still foldable.

**THE ECONOMICS KILL IT.** The replacement needs one O(2^m)
`fold_stripe_outer` pass — the same kernel lincheck uses,
`partial_fold_packed_z_best`. Timed at the production shape
(m=30, k_log=14, useful_bits=11_707, 8 threads): **3.80 ms**, against the
**2.59 ms** of C-side work it would delete (measured above).

| | fold ADDED | work REMOVED | net | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RS §stripe | 180 ms | 250 ms | **−70** | 0.72 |
| **AG** | **3.80 ms** | **2.59 ms** | **+1.21** | **1.47** |

The fold's cost is set by the WITNESS SIZE, not by how efficient round 1
is. RS won because its C side was expensive (a bit transpose plus 32 of
48 gathers per lane). AG's round 1 is already far leaner — its whole C
side is 21% of a 12.3 ms phase — so the same fixed-cost pass no longer
pays. Nor can the fold be shared with lincheck: lincheck folds at its
own challenge point, not round 1's.

NOT BUILT. The derivation above is the reusable part: if AG's C side ever
grows, or a stripe fold becomes available for free from a neighbouring
phase, it can be implemented directly from the formula.

### AG's C side decomposed: the transpose is free, the multiplies are a roofline — 2026-09-01

Follow-up to §stripe-for-AG ("any idea of how to not add work?"). Before
inventing a cheaper C path it is worth knowing WHICH half of the C cost
a cheaper path would have to beat. Split with a const-generic probe
(`C_MODE`, resolved outside the loop — the LazyLock-in-hot-path
contamination trap from earlier today) inside
`transpose_fold_c_banks_2src`, guarding its two stages separately.
ag_breakdown, m=30, production 92/128 shape, 10 threads, 3 reps, round-1
URM median (ms):

| arm | r1 URM | Δ vs base | share of C |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 12.26 | — | — |
| no bit transpose | 12.15 | **−0.11** | 4% |
| no bank multiplies | 9.61 | **−2.64** | 96% |

**The bit transpose is free; the whole C side is the 128 `mul_acc_unred`
bank accumulates.** So every structural idea aimed at the transpose —
fusing C's transpose into the AB `transpose_128x128_2src` as a 3-source
transpose, hoisting the `ws` staging buffer, a stripe that "removes the
per-window bit transpose" — is chasing 0.11 ms of a 12.26 ms round 1.

And the 2.64 ms is at the PMULL roofline. m=30 is 2^30 bits = 2^17
blocks of 8192; 128 `mul_acc_unred` per block at 4 PMULL each is 67.1 M
PMULL. Eight P-cores at 3.2 GHz and 1 PMULL/cycle is 25.6 G PMULL/s =
**2.62 ms predicted vs 2.64 ms measured.** The kernel is saturated.

Why the count cannot be reduced. The bitmask `x` is treated as a GF
polynomial, so ONE `eq · x` covers 128 outer positions at once — the sum
over positions is already free inside the multiply. That leaves 128
destination banks × one eq-weight per block, all distinct, so there is
nothing to XOR-before-multiplying. The eq-factoring route (group 2^t
blocks sharing a prefix, `eq = E_p · w_s` with the `w_s` constant across
groups) does not help either: the inner `Σ_s w_s·x_s` is a sum of
POLYNOMIAL products, not a table index, so it still costs 2^t multiplies.
The subset-sum-table trick that makes this work on the RS side needs the
`x_s` to be indices, and here they are field elements. Karatsuba would
cut 4 PMULL to 3, and it has now been refuted three times on this core.

**VERDICT: no. There is no way to make the C side cheaper without adding
work, because the work is already minimal and running at machine peak.**
The C side is 21.5% of AG round 1, which is 51.3 ms of the m=32 MT
prove — so the entire theoretical prize here is ~11 ms of 900 ms (1.2%),
and the reachable fraction of it is zero. Probe reverted; tree clean.

**Where the AG headroom actually is, by contrast:** `prove_fast_union_ag`
is a complete verifying path (roundtrip test at blake3.rs:2421) that is
10.9% faster than RS single-threaded and −60 ms of zerocheck at MT, and
it is NOT the default — `BLAKE3_ZC=ag` is opt-in, gated aarch64-only
because the round-1 kernel is NEON. Promoting it (with an RS fallback
for other targets) is worth ~30× what any remaining C-side kernel idea
could return, and costs no new kernel code.

### Promoting AG to the default: −5.8% end to end, MT, 4/4 — 2026-09-01

The claim above ("worth ~30× any remaining C-side idea") should carry a
number, so: paired alternating A/B of the two flavors at their MT optima
on the real m=32 prove — arm A `rs_sparse` (today's default), arm B
`ag_dense` (AG's MT optimum; sparse costs AG 3.2× at MT). Best
prove_fast per invocation, 4 pairs, order rotated.

| | best | median |
|---|---|---|
| rs (default) | 894.82 | 919.74 |
| ag | **862.73** | **866.61** |

**Median −53.1 ms = −5.8%, AG wins 4/4.** Throughput 292,955 → 303,853
c/s at the best-of. AG also has the tighter spread (862.7–881.2 vs
894.8–928.3), consistent with the ST reading where AG was 10.9% ahead.

For scale: every optimization the whole port campaign kept is worth
1.027× (−2.7%). **This one dispatch change is worth more than all of
them combined**, and it is not new kernel code — the path exists, has a
prove→verify roundtrip test (blake3.rs:2421), and is exercised by
ag_breakdown. The work is dispatch and fallback: `prove_fast_union_ag`
is aarch64-only because the genus-95 round-1 kernel is NEON, so making
it the default means selecting AG on aarch64 and RS elsewhere, plus
deciding whether the MT dense/sparse gate follows the flavor (it must:
sparse is AG's ST optimum and its MT pessimum).

### AG PROMOTED TO DEFAULT — −8.2% end to end, 4/4 — 2026-09-01

Acting on the AG-default lever measured earlier today. Two corrections to
the record came first, both from Benedikt's pushback that the "sparse
costs AG 3.2×" reading smelled like a timing error. He was right:

**1. Sparse is AG's optimum, on every stage.** Paired, m=32, MT, same
binary, min-per-phase (ms):

| stage | AG sparse | AG dense |
|---|---|---|
| round 1 | **55.65** | 57.09 |
| skip→mlv fold | **41.06** | 47.21 |
| mlv tail | **47.75** | 65.66 |
| zc + lincheck | **183.19** | 209.32 |

End to end AG sparse beats AG dense 4/4 (median −41.5 ms). The
2026-08-31 entry claiming a 657 ms sparse tail is marked SUPERSEDED in
place. Attribution unresolved — flagged, not chased.

**2. The promotion, measured in the SHIPPED config** (both arms on the
default sparse gate; AG via the new default, RS via `BLAKE3_ZC=rs`):

| | best | median |
|---|---|---|
| rs | 934.97 | 966.10 |
| ag | **851.36** | **894.75** |

**Median −79.4 ms = −8.2%, AG 4/4** (deltas −111.7 / −83.6 / −75.1 /
−67.6). Best-of throughput 280,377 → **307,912 c/s**. Larger than the
−5.8% measured this morning, because that comparison used AG *dense*.
Absolute numbers ran ~7% high across both arms in this batch (warmer
machine than the morning window) — the paired delta is the signal.

WHAT LANDED:
- `blake3_proof` / `sha2_proof` benches: zerocheck flavor defaults to AG
  on aarch64, RS elsewhere; `BLAKE3_ZC=rs` / `SHA2_ZC=rs` force the RS
  arm. Same selector convention as the tower's `leaf_zc_ag()` /
  `outer_zc_ag()`, which have defaulted to AG since Phase B/C — the flat
  prover was the last un-promoted surface.
- `Sha256HybridSetup::prove_fast_union_ag` + `verify_union_ag`, the
  mechanical twin of the BLAKE3 pair (SHA-256 had no AG entry at all),
  with `sha2_prove_fast_union_ag_roundtrip` covering verify + round-1
  tamper + off-schedule-nonce rejection. Green.
- `proof_io::R1csProofBundleLigeritoAg` on new wire flavor byte 5, plus
  `BundleFlavor::R1csAg`. Needed because the blake3 bench previously
  SKIPPED peak-memory/verify/proof-size whenever AG was selected — with
  AG now the default that would have silently dropped three headline
  lines from every report. Both arms now report all three.
  AG's proof is ~1.5 KB larger than RS's (305,436 vs 303,936 B at m=24).

WHAT IS **NOT** DONE — RS REMOVAL IS BLOCKED, and not by preference:
`docs/ag-recursion-plan.md` Phase F.1 is explicit that the AG round-1
prover kernel is aarch64-NEON-only (`genus95_curve_code/round1.rs` is
`#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]` with a bare `use std::arch::aarch64::*`),
so deleting RS without an AVX-512 port **kills x86 proving outright** —
and `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs a first-class x86_64 leg pinned to
`sapphirerapids` precisely to exercise those kernels. Phase F.2 adds the
same blocker for CUDA. RS also still owns every transcript byte pin
(m6 merged fixtures, mixed-class pins, chain/Merkle/keccak3/sha2). So
the parallel `*Ag` API stays until those kernels exist, exactly as the
plan prescribes; `prove_fast` keeps its type and its callers.

### Dead-scaffolding cleanup alongside the AG promotion — 2026-09-01

Scope chosen by Benedikt: delete only what is genuinely unreachable, keep
RS compiling as the x86 fallback. Method: take the dead-code list under
`cargo clippy --release --workspace --all-targets` on BOTH arches
(aarch64 natively, x86_64 via `--target x86_64-apple-darwin -C
target-cpu=sapphirerapids`, which is what CI's x86 leg pins) and delete
only the intersection — anything dead on one arch alone is a live
fallback on the other.

DELETED (dead on both):
- `r1cs_hashes/common.rs`: the whole full-write witness cluster —
  `drive_witness_packed_and_lincheck_full_write`, `witness_scratch_tag`,
  `WITNESS_ROLE_{Z,A,B}` (~105 lines), plus `BitRecord::words()` whose
  doc still pointed at a `PackedWordWriter::push_record` caller that no
  longer calls it.
- `zerocheck/multilinear/kernels/aarch64.rs`: `fold_and_message_neon`
  and `lookahead_chunk_neon` (~250 lines) — zero references anywhere in
  the workspace; superseded by the fused round-2 kernel and the cascade
  tail.

KEPT, with the reason recorded in code:
- `ag_skip::byte_dot_u64` reads dead on aarch64 only because today's
  NEON `byte_dot` bypasses it; it is the LIVE x86 path. Gated
  `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "aarch64"))]` so it stops tripping the arm64
  lint leg's `-D warnings` without removing the fallback.

TWO PRE-EXISTING BUGS FOUND WHILE VALIDATING, both fixed:
1. **A silently disabled test.** `stripe_c_banks_match_drain_banks`
   (univariate_skip_optimized.rs) sits between two `#[test]` functions
   but had lost its own attribute, so it had never run. Restored — it
   PASSES, so this is recovered coverage, not a latent failure.
2. **The x86 test crate did not compile.**
   `neon_fused_inner_matches_scalar_inner` calls
   `shift_reduce_inner_ab_fused_neon`, which does not exist off aarch64,
   with no arch gate — so CI's x86_64 leg was failing to build
   `flock-core`'s tests before any of today's work. Gated. Verified at
   HEAD to confirm it was not introduced here.

AFTER: zero dead-code warnings on aarch64, `--workspace --all-targets`
compiles clean on BOTH arches, workspace tests **637 passed / 0 failed**
(one more than before, from the restored test). Perf unchanged by the
cleanup: 850.27 ms best = **308,307 c/s**.

Full AG report at m=32 (the bench reports these under AG for the first
time): peak memory **8065 MB** vs RS's 8525 — AG holds ~460 MB less —
verify 6.17 ms, proof 451.22 KiB vs RS's 449.76 (+1.46 KiB).

NOTE for future sessions: `cargo fmt --all` under rustfmt 1.8.0 rewrites
~11 committed files that were formatted by an older stable, and local
`clippy -D warnings` fails workspace-wide on pre-existing
`unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` (E0133) and an unknown-lint name. Neither is
actionable here; format and lint only the files you touch.

### Witness generation attributed — 64 ms nobody was timing, and it is at roofline — 2026-09-01

**The trace was lying about witgen.** `[prove_union] witgen` prints
0.00 ms, but that timer only wraps `build_union_witness`, and with a
single PREBUILT slot that is a passthrough. The actual generation runs in
`generate_witness_batch_major_partial`, called by
`prove_fast_union_ag` BEFORE `prove_fast_ligerito_union_ag` — i.e.
entirely outside the `[prove_union]` region. It shows up only as the gap
between `[prove_union] TOTAL` (788 ms) and `best prove_fast` (~850 ms):
**~64 ms, 7.6% of the prove, unattributed by every previous session.**

Also fixed the micro-bench, which had the same disease round-2 had:
`genwitness_phase` drove `generate_witness_with_ab_packed_and_lincheck`,
the legacy ROW-MAJOR generator reached only from the retired direct-AG
route. Production is BatchMajor. Repointed at
`generate_witness_batch_major_partial` and extended to m=32 (the shipped
size), with a checksum. It reads **110 ms standalone** at m=32 (higher
than the in-prove 64 ms because the prove has the pool warm).

STAGE ATTRIBUTION (m=32, best-of, const-read-once env probe inside
`drive_witness_batch_major_partial_into`; probes are NOT additive —
removing one lets others overlap):

| stage | cost | note |
|---|---|---|
| `flush_rows_nt` ×3 | 25.7 ms | 1.5 GB of NT stores = **~58 GB/s, roofline** |
| `per_group` (BLAKE3 build) | 17.8 ms | the only real compute |
| padding-suffix memset | 15.0 ms | 432 MB — **required, see below** |
| `stripe_from_rows` | 12.8 ms | |
| stripe tail clear | 7.8 ms | 153 MB |
| per-group row fill | 6.2 ms | 1.15 GB, L1-resident |

**TWO NULL RESULTS, both instructive:**

1. **`UnionSlotProverInput::in_place` is NEUTRAL** (median +0.2 ms, 2/4)
   despite its own doc saying "prefer in_place on the hot path: at M=30
   the scatter is ~10 ms". Reason: for a SINGLE slot the prebuilt path
   is already an aliasing passthrough, so there is no scatter to remove.
   The doc's advice is about multi-slot unions.

2. **The padding memsets cannot be elided here — a COMPLETENESS
   constraint, not soundness.** (Benedikt caught me using the wrong
   word: padding is written entirely prover-side, and a cheating prover
   may put anything there, so it cannot affect what a verifier accepts.
   What breaks is the HONEST prover's own proof.) At FULL utilization
   `compaction_is_identity()` is true (single slot at offset 0,
   `n_t == 1<<nu`), so q IS the padded buffer: the committed polynomial
   includes the padding, while the zerocheck/lincheck claims are
   computed as if it were zero. The opening then disagrees with the
   claim.

   VERIFIED, not argued — forcing `padding_unread` true at full
   utilization on the in-place path (the only path that consults it;
   the all-prebuilt path returns `PooledZeroed` unconditionally via
   `assemble_witness`) makes the m=28 prove fail its own verify with
   **`union-AG verify failed: PcsOpen(Ligerito)`** — exactly the
   predicted failure site. At partial utilization the elide already
   kicks in automatically and verify passes.

   **This re-opens the 15 ms as a live target.** Because the constraint
   is only that the committed padding BE zero — not that anything read
   it — the fix is not "skip the writes" but "keep last prove's zeros".
   The padding suffix is shape-invariant across proves, so a witness
   buffer returned to a DEDICATED pool class comes back with its padding
   already zero and needs no memset. The scratch pool already has the
   machinery for exactly this: `take_f128_tagged` returns a `hit` flag
   and `witness_scratch_tag`/`WITNESS_ROLE_*` were built to let a
   builder "elide on a hit" — that cluster was unreferenced and got
   deleted in today's cleanup, but its design is the right one and it is
   recoverable from git. NOT attempted; sized at ~15 ms (1.8%).

**VERDICT: witgen is MOSTLY irreducible** — ~26 ms of NT stores runs at
bandwidth roofline and ~18 ms is the BLAKE3 witness compute. The one
genuinely addressable item is the 15 ms padding memset, via a
padding-preserving buffer pool (above), which is worth a session. The
durable improvement landed today is the corrected micro-bench. Probes
reverted.

### Round 3 (AG/sparse tail): the friendly-Horner kernel is NEVER used — 2026-09-01

Attribution only; no code change yet. The AG tail under the shipped
sparse dispatch is 46–48 ms (of ~850 ms). The 2026-08-31 entry's
MECHANISM claim survives even though its numbers did not:
`fold_and_friendly_round_pair_into` (the γ-geometric Horner kernel with
no per-term `eq_lo` PMULL) has exactly ONE production call site,
`mlv_tail_fs_resume` (ag_skip.rs:1655), and it only fires for rounds
`i ∈ 1..=5`. The other call site (:2124) is the
`friendly_round_matches_general` test.

`mlv_tail_fs_sparse` runs the sparse rounds with the general RS kernel
(`fold_and_round_pair_sparse_into`, friendly constants riding as
ordinary `r_next` weights), then expands to dense and resumes. **Probed
at m=32: the sparse loop consumes rounds 0..18 and hands off at i=18** —
so on the AG/sparse path the friendly rounds 1–5 are ALREADY GONE by the
time the friendly-capable code is reached. The kernel never runs.

Sizing the prize honestly: with the domain halving each round, rounds
1–5 (2^24…2^20) are ~48% of the tail's 2^26 total work, so ~22 ms is
addressable, and the friendly kernel's saving within that is the
per-term `eq_lo` PMULL — call it 20–40%. **Realistic prize ≈ 5–10 ms,
i.e. 0.6–1.2% of the prove.** Worth doing, not spectacular; it needs a
new `fold_and_friendly_round_pair_sparse_into` mirroring the dense
kernel over `LiveLayout` intervals. NOT started — flagged with the
mechanism verified so the next session can start from the kernel.

Note this also explains why AG-sparse beats AG-dense on the tail
(47.75 vs 65.66) DESPITE forfeiting the friendly kernel: skipping the
147,456 dead blocks is worth more than the friendly Horner. The two wins
are independent and should compound.

### Tagged witness-buffer pool: BUILT, and it structurally cannot hit — 2026-09-01

Following up the completeness correction: since the padding suffix only
has to BE zero, not go unread, the move is to keep last prove's zeros via
the scratch pool's provenance tags. Built it end to end:

- `UnionInstance::witness_buffer_tag(role)` — FNV over `m_total`, `n_log`,
  and per type `k_log`/`useful_bits`/offset/`m_slot`/count, version-stamped,
  namespaced so it cannot collide with another tag family. Everything the
  suffix boundary `ceil(useful_bits/128) << n_log` depends on.
- `UnionInstance::witness_buffers_are_passthrough()` — the single-slot
  spanning case, where `assemble_witness` moves a slot's buffers through
  unchanged so take-site and give-site layouts are provably identical.
- `take_witness_buffers` takes `a`/`b` via `take_f128_tagged` and returns
  hit flags; `SlotWitnessDest` carries `padding_already_zero: [bool; 3]`;
  the driver skips exactly that buffer's suffix fill, with a
  `debug_assert` re-verifying the suffix really is zero on a hit.
  `z` is deliberately never tagged — the aliased open folds over it.
- Give-back at prover.rs returns `a`/`b` tagged.
- `prove_fast_union_ag` switched to `in_place`, the only path that reaches
  `take_witness_buffers` at all.

It builds, verifies, and the debug-assert vouch holds under
`-C debug-assertions=on`. A 6-pair A/B on the witgen line read median
−1.46 ms, 3/6 — noise. **Then the reason: the tag NEVER HITS.** Traced
both ends: the give fires every prove with a stable tag
(`0x571dac7a374f798e`) and matching length; every subsequent take returns
`a_hit=false b_hit=false`, at m=28 and m=32 alike. So both A/B arms were
executing identical code and the "null" measured nothing.

**MECHANISM — and it is structural, not a bug.** The pool clears a tag on
"any other custody event — an untagged take". The witness buffers are
handed back MID-PROVE (right after the boolean zerocheck), and the open
stage then runs and is the single largest consumer of pooled `F128`
scratch; `take_f128` prefers the smallest capacity ≥ n, so it takes our
just-returned buffer and strips the tag long before the next prove asks
for it.

The two fixes both lose more than they win:
- Hold the witness buffers back until the prove ends → the open faults
  fresh pages instead of reusing that memory, which the pool's own doc
  records as a **+24% open_batch regression on M4**.
- A separate reserved pool → ~1 GB extra residency for the same reason.

So the mid-prove give-back is load-bearing, and it is worth far more than
the ~10 ms the padding skip could return. **This is very likely why
`witness_scratch_tag`/`WITNESS_ROLE_*` were built and then left
unreferenced** — the design is sound, the lifetime is not. Reverted.

REVISED VERDICT on witgen: irreducible after all, but now for a
demonstrated reason rather than the wrong one I gave first. The 15 ms
padding memset is real, is required (completeness), and cannot be
amortized across proves without giving up a larger win in the open.

### LANDED: a/b padding columns are never read — −10.9 ms witgen, −6.7 ms prove — 2026-09-01

Benedikt pushed back that witgen spending only ~16% on actual BLAKE3 was
weird and asked whether memory work could be deferred or omitted. It can,
and I had mis-scoped the constraint earlier today.

**The identity-compaction argument only ever applied to `z`.** Under
identity compaction `q` IS the `z` buffer, so `z`'s padding words are
COMMITTED and must be honest zeros. `a` and `b` are never committed —
their only consumers are the run-list-gated zerocheck (Dead blocks
skipped, Partial cleansed; both flavors) and the count-proportional
lincheck. The old code zeroed all three because one predicate,
`padding_unread`, conflated "is this committed" with "does anyone read
it".

PROVEN, not argued: poisoning the a/b padding suffix with
`DEADBEEF/0BADF00D` instead of zeroing it leaves the serialized proof
**byte-identical** — checked at m=32 AG (fnv 7b3455b91c9e8f8b) and m=28
RS (52d35e07443300ae).

WHAT LANDED:
- `SlotWitnessDest::ab_padding_unread`, certified by the union in
  `build_union_witness` as `!has_element() && m_total - n_log >=
  LOG_PACKING` — i.e. the existing `padding_unread` predicate MINUS its
  identity-compaction clause, which says nothing about a/b. The driver
  then zeroes `z`'s suffix always and a/b's only when uncertified, so
  the strict generator contract still holds for every direct caller and
  `batch_major_partial_zeroes_dummy_rows` keeps passing unchanged.
- `prove_fast_union_ag` (BLAKE3 and SHA-256) switched to
  `UnionSlotProverInput::in_place` — the only path that reaches
  `slot_dests`, so the only one that can carry the certification. Neutral
  on its own, and it also makes `[prove_union] witgen` honest: it read
  0.00 ms for a 64 ms phase because the single-slot prebuilt source is a
  passthrough.
- `ab_padding_columns_are_never_read` — a permanent guard that proves the
  same witness twice, poisoning exactly that region on one run, and pins
  the proofs byte-identical. It also asserts `ab_padding_unread` is set,
  so it cannot silently stop exercising the skip.

MEASURED: witgen micro-bench m=32 **−10.9 ms, 4/4** (101.4 vs 112.3
median) — 288 MB of the 432 MB memset gone. End to end, paired,
same-binary knob: **median −6.74 ms, skip wins 4/5**; best prove 795.10
ms = **329,699 c/s**, and in-prove witgen 64 → 41.4 ms. The end-to-end
figure is smaller than the micro-bench's because part of the memset
overlaps other work.

NOT DONE: `prove_fast` (the RS x86 fallback) still uses the allocating
prebuilt path and so does not get this. Same win is available there, but
RS owns the m6 transcript fixtures, so it wants its own byte-identity
check first.

Two things NOT the cause, both refuted en route: NT (`stnp`) zero-fill of
the suffix (neutral 3/3 — macOS memset already avoids RFO), and the
tagged-pool amortization (never hits; see the entry above).

ALSO: `mixed_blake3_sha256_roundtrip_and_tamper` FAILS AT HEAD, before
any of today's work — a tampered lincheck round now returns
`InvalidGrindingNonce` where the test expects `ConsistencyFailed`. The
honest proof still verifies; the test over-specifies which rejection
fires. Verified by stashing every local change. Pre-existing, not
investigated further, flagged here so the next session does not blame it
on this change.

### LANDED: stripe tail joins the dead-padding skip — −3.2 ms witgen — 2026-09-01

Second half of the "omit the memory work" thread. The lincheck stripe's
tail (rows `>= ceil(useful_bits/64)` of each 8-block group, 153 MB at
m=32) was cleared on every prove.

**Why it is dead:** the stripe has exactly ONE reader,
`partial_fold_packed_z_rows_best` (lincheck/union.rs:369), and it is
handed `ty.useful_bits` and `n_t` explicitly — its own doc says it
"threads `useful_bits` through so the kernel can skip blocks past the
useful region of each block". So the tail is never touched, on either
the full (`partial_fold_packed_z_best`) or row-prefix
(`partial_fold_packed_z_rows_padded`) arm.

Rather than add a second flag, `SlotWitnessDest::ab_padding_unread` was
generalized to **`dead_padding_unread`** covering both dead regions —
a/b padding columns and the stripe tail — with each region's reader named
in the doc. Same certification, same predicate, one extra `if`. `z` is
still excluded: its padding is committed.

MEASURED (genwitness_phase, m=32, 8 alternating pairs, min-of-run):
**median −3.24 ms, skip wins 8/8** (82.99 vs 87.12) — every delta
negative, range −0.76 to −4.67. Below the 5.4 ms the 153 MB would
suggest at ~28 GB/s, so part of the clear was already overlapping.

COMBINED with the a/b skip, end to end at m=32, paired, same-binary
knob: **median −22.4 ms, 4/6**; best prove **825.59 ms = 317,523 c/s**
(deltas −44.4/−28.9/−23.5/−21.2/+1.4/+16.6). Larger than the ~14 ms of
witgen the two skips account for — the rest is knock-on (441 MB fewer
dirty pages and less cache pollution ahead of the commit).

The guard test is now `dead_padding_regions_are_never_read`: it poisons
BOTH regions on one of two otherwise identical proves — a/b before
generation, the stripe tail after, on its way to the lincheck — and pins
the proofs byte-identical. It also asserts the certification flag is set,
so it cannot silently stop exercising the skip.

Workspace 637/637, x86 `--all-targets` clean, no probe knobs left in the
tree.

**Witgen scoreboard at m=32** (standalone micro-bench, was 110 ms):
now ~83 ms. Remaining: `flush_rows_nt` ×3 ≈ 26 ms (1.5 GB of NT stores
at ~58 GB/s — bandwidth roofline, and it is the required output),
`per_group` BLAKE3 build ≈ 18 ms, `stripe_from_rows` ≈ 13 ms, `z`'s
required padding memset ≈ 5 ms, per-group row fill ≈ 6 ms. The two
skippable regions are now skipped; what is left is either the answer or
the bus.

### Does §elision ("write it once") apply to flush_rows_nt? Ceiling measured: ~1 ms — 2026-09-01

Benedikt asked whether `flush_rows_nt` is what the LaTeX doc attacks —
`docs/zerocheck-optimizations.tex` §sec:elision, "Witness constant-region
elision via scratch provenance": tag a pooled buffer with its layout
provenance and, on a hit, skip rewriting the regions identical across
every prove of that layout ("$b$'s all-ones prefix and reserved-slot
words and all three streams' zero tails").

**Yes, that is the same idea — and today's dead-padding work already took
the part of it that pays.** The doc lists three constant regions; "all
three streams' zero tails" is exactly the padding suffix + stripe tail
now skipped via `dead_padding_unread`, worth −22 ms end to end. What
remains of §elision is the constant regions INSIDE the useful data,
which is what would let `flush_rows_nt` write less.

**Ceiling, measured directly** (three witnesses from independent seeds,
n=2^8, counting useful F128 words identical across all three):

| stream | input-independent |
|---|---|
| z | **0.0 %** |
| a | **0.0 %** |
| b | **12.0 %** |
| lincheck stripe | 0.8 % |

Consistent with §sec:zeroskip's own tally (38 of 256 eight-byte K-rows of
`b` pinned regardless of input = 14.8% at 64-bit granularity; a 128-bit
word is constant only if both halves are, hence 12%).

So `flush_rows_nt` writes 1.5 GB of which **~4% is even theoretically
skippable** (12% of the `b` third). Against its measured ~26 ms that is
**~1 ms**, and it would cost a per-row branch inside a streaming NT-store
loop. The doc's own number agrees this was never large: 4/5 paired,
147.0–149.0 vs 148.3–152.7 ms.

**Two further blockers specific to this branch:**
1. §elision operated on the ROW-MAJOR full-write builder
   (`drive_witness_packed_and_lincheck_full_write` + `witness_scratch_tag`
   + `WITNESS_ROLE_*`). That cluster was UNREFERENCED at HEAD — production
   is the batch-major union builder — and was deleted in today's cleanup.
2. Its prerequisite does not hold here anyway: the provenance tag NEVER
   HITS in the union pipeline (traced this session — the witness buffers
   are returned mid-prove and the open stage, the largest consumer of
   pooled F128 scratch, takes them and strips the tag).

**VERDICT: `flush_rows_nt`'s ~26 ms is the required output at bandwidth
roofline.** 96% of those bytes genuinely differ every prove. The "write
it once" idea was right about the zero tails — which is where today's
−22 ms came from — and is worth ~1 ms on everything else.

### The open, audited — cold vs warm, one −13 ms fix, and a pool lesson — 2026-09-01

Applying the doc's own rule ("audit where the buffers come from before
porting compute") to the phase no campaign had profiled. Instrument:
`LIG_PROVE_TRACE=1` — the production basis prover
(`extension::recursive_prover_with_basis_impl`) already carries a full
per-bucket breakdown behind that flag; `FLOCK_LIG_TIMING` only covers
the per-level commits, which is why earlier sessions saw 49 of 279 ms
and called the rest "unexamined".

**FIRST FINDING: the 279 ms I had been quoting was the COLD prove.**
The recursive prover is **~181 ms warm** at m=32. The ~100 ms gap is
first-prove-in-process cost: ~26 ms is one `give_f256` whose pool
eviction frees a multi-hundred-MB buffer (munmap), the rest is cold
recursive folds (`fold_extension` collects fresh, page-faulting once)
and a cold fold 5. `best prove_fast` is a warm minimum, so none of this
was in the headline — but it is ~12% of first-prove latency and should
be on the list for a serving deployment.

**WARM recursive prover, 181 ms:**

| bucket | ms | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| initial_k folds + switch | 76 | fold 1 = 40 (below), switch 9.5 (fixed) |
| recursive commits | 47 | NTT 29 + merkle 18; examined earlier |
| L0 OOD (eq build + eval) | 23 | ≈ memory roofline for 512 MB write + 1 GB read |
| induce | 14 | not examined |
| level OODs | 10.5 | not examined |
| recursive folds + switches | 5.7 | nothing there warm |

Fold 1 (`fused_first_fold2_virtual`, 2^25 → 2^23): **compute roofline.**
Per output it does `13 + 3T` F128 multiplies (fold2 = 7, `la_msg_quad`
= 6, virtual basis `scale·lo·hi` = 3 per term); ST 208 ms over 2^23
outputs is ~79 cycles/output ≈ 16 PMULL-throughput multiplies. MT 40 ms
= 5.2× on 8P+2E — the E-core dilution is the only slack (~10 ms).

Outside the recursive prover: **W build 33 ms and combine 45 ms both
scale ~7× ST→MT** (234→33, 334→45), so they are parallel and
compute-bound (4–7 F128 muls per element), not allocation problems.

**LANDED: the code switch's serial promotion.** `code_switch_message`
did `words.into_iter().map(F256::from).collect()` — SERIAL over 2^20
elements, 4.25 ms, into a fresh allocation — while its neighbour
`introduce_ood_with_eval` uses `into_par_iter`. Parallelized, plus
`alloc_uninit` instead of `vec![ZERO; …]` for the two split buffers
(16 + 32 MB of zeroing gone). Init switch **9.52 → 3–4 ms**, fold 5
12.6 → 6–7, **warm recursive prover 181 → 166–169 ms** over four warm
proves. Bit-identical: the m6 transcript fixtures pass, proof size
unchanged.

**THE LESSON, which cost 20 minutes and is worth recording:** my first
version ALSO routed the three switch buffers through the scratch pool
(`take_f128`/`take_f256`/`give_f128`). The switch got faster still
(2.2 ms) — and the NEXT fold went from 3 ms to 21–62 ms, wildly
variable, and the recursive prover got SLOWER overall (206–269 ms).
Mechanism: `MAX_POOLED = 24` with evict-from-most-populated-class. Three
new 16–32 MB entries per switch tip the class balance, the policy
evicts buffers the fold reuses, the fold's `take_f256` misses and
page-faults (or an eviction munmap lands mid-fold). **Adding pool
traffic is not a local change.** Fresh allocations for short-lived
mid-phase buffers are malloc-recycled on warm proves and stay out of
the pool's accounting — that is the right default for anything that is
not one of the ~18 long-lived per-prove buffers the pool was sized for.

Remaining in the open, warm: induce 14 + level OODs 10.5 (unexamined),
the E-core dilution on fold 1 (~10), L0 OOD's materialized 512 MB eq
table (a virtual-basis variant exists for the folds; ~10 ms if the eval
sweep could use it — speculative). And the cold-prove tax.

### The zc tail, per round — lookahead is a wash and friendly-Horner is 2–3× SLOWER — 2026-09-01

Per-round probe inside `mlv_tail_fs_sparse` at m=32 (AG/sparse, warm
prove 2). The live layout is ONE prefix interval every round (the 92/128
useful chunk-columns are a prefix), at 71.9% of the domain.

| round | domain | MT ms (8 thr, quiet) | ST ms | ST/MT |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 2^26 → 2^25 | 43.3 | 209.4 | 4.8× |
| 2 | 2^25 | 12.2 | 80.0 | 6.6× |
| 3 | 2^24 | 4.6 | 33.2 | 7.2× |
| 4 | 2^23 | 2.4 | 16.6 | 7.0× |
| 5 | 2^22 | 1.3 | 8.3 | 6.5× |
| 6–17 | | ~2.5 | ~9 | |

Round 1 is 59% of the tail and rounds 1–5 are 93%. Rounds 2–5 scale ~7×
(compute-bound); round 1 ~5× (its 2.3 GB per pass is partly bus-bound).
NOTE `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8` bypasses the bench's perf pool and reads
~35% worse than the default 10-thread pool (tail 66 vs 48) — do not use
it to "match" another prover's thread count.

**Lookahead ladder (dense `fold1/fold2_lookahead_into`): NULL per
element.** Probed the dense route's passes at m=32: ST 338.5 (fold1-la,
2^26→2^25) + 112.0 + 28.2 + 7.1 + … = 488 ms over 100% of 2^26 =
7.3 ns/elt, against the sparse classic kernel's 356 ms over 71.9% =
7.4 ns/elt. Counting multiplies explains it: the ENTRY pass `fold1-la`
does 3 muls/input for a single halving (classic round 1: 2), so the
ladder totals ~15% MORE arithmetic than classic, cancelling its ~23%
traffic saving. Porting it to the sparse prefix would gain nothing.
This also explains why AG-dense (with lookahead) loses to AG-sparse
(without) on the tail: same per-element cost, 39% more elements.

**Friendly-Horner on the sparse prefix: BUILT, correct, and 2–2.7×
SLOWER.** With a single prefix interval the dense
`fold_and_friendly_round_pair_into::<SHIFT>` runs on the compact buffer
unchanged (its chunking follows `a_out.len()`, indexing is
chunk-relative; only a debug_assert needed relaxing). Wired for rounds
1..=5, same-binary A/B via a knob:

| | friendly | general |
|---|---:|---:|
| MT round 1 | 86.1 | 43.0 |
| MT tail | 156.6 | 66.4 |
| ST round 1 | 552.4 | 203.2 |
| ST tail | 1059.7 | 347.0 |

Roundtrips (debug assertions on), verify, and
`friendly_round_matches_general` all pass — it is bit-identical and
simply slow. The kernel trades 2 unreduced eq_lo multiplies per pair
(8 PMULL + 3 XOR, a 1-cycle accumulate chain) for 2 `shl_xor::<SHIFT>`
on 384-bit `F256Unreduced` accumulators — more instructions AND a
loop-carried shift chain. It was never load-bearing: in the dense resume
it only fires when NOT in lookahead mode with len ≥ 1024, i.e. only
under the `LOOKAHEAD_DISABLE` toggle. **The 2026-08-31 claim that the
sparse tail "forfeits the friendly kernel at 5.5×" had the sign wrong:
the sparse path is faster partly BECAUSE it never runs it.** Reverted.
Flag for cleanup: the friendly branch in `mlv_tail_fs_resume` is dead
in production and measurably worse than the general kernel where it
would run.

**Where the tail's time actually is:** the general sparse kernel's inner
loop is scalar-style F128 arithmetic (`a0 + r*(a1+a0)`, `mul_unreduced`
into `F256Unreduced`) — the same shape round 2's `fold_pair_run` had
before §wideneon/§qres took it 281.7 → 236.1 ms ST (−16%). That NEON
register-residency treatment is the remaining kernel-level lever on the
tail: ~−55 ms ST, ~−8 ms MT on the 48 ms tail. Not started.

Cross-prover: the challenge tree's tail is 28 ms MT to our 48 — but its
"round 2 + tail" is 73 vs our "fold + tail" 89, and the domains and
round boundaries differ, so the comparable gap is ~16 ms, not 20.

### CORRECTION: lookahead is NOT a wash — the entry pass is; fold2-cascade pays — 2026-09-01

The Yukon session pushed back on "lookahead null per element": their tail
uses `fold2_and_message_lookahead_*` (two halvings + message per pass,
cascaded all the way down), not the fold1 entry shape I measured. Also,
"friendly" in their tree names round-1 CHALLENGE CONSTANTS (7 fixed
constants so eq factors geometrically), not a Horner kernel — so my
friendly-Horner refutation has no counterpart there; it stands on its
own for AG.

Re-deriving from my own dense-vs-classic probe, per PASS, scaled to equal
element counts (classic sparse ÷ 0.71875):

| pass | ST ladder | ST classic equiv | Δ | MT ladder | MT classic equiv | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| entry fold1-la @2^26 (1 halving) | 338.5 | 291.3 | **+16%** | 53.7 | 60.2 | −11% |
| fold2-la @2^25 (rounds 2+3) | 112.0 | 157.5 | **−29%** | 14.9 | 23.4 | **−36%** |
| fold2-la @2^23 (rounds 4+5) | 28.2 | 34.6 | −19% | 3.8 | 5.1 | −25% |
| fold2-la @2^21 (6+7) | 7.1 | 8.7 | −19% | 1.0 | 1.3 | −23% |
| **total** | 488 | 495 | −1% | **74** | **92** | **−20%** |

So the steady fold2 passes are 19–36% cheaper than the two classic rounds
they replace; the ENTRY pass is 16% dearer than the one round it replaces
and it is the biggest round, which is why the ST total nets to a wash.
At MT the ladder is already −20% in total — I had compared it against a
CONTENDED classic number (71 ms) and called it parity; the quiet figure
(66) says otherwise. The earlier "porting the ladder to the sparse prefix
would be null" is therefore WRONG at MT and right only at ST.

**Revised lever — a prefix fold2-cascade tail:**
1. `fold2_lookahead_into` on the live prefix: eq sized from `rest` (not
   `a.len()`), iteration bounded by `a.len()`; the prefix is 23·2^k and
   aligns to the eq-hi chunks for every round that matters.
2. Enter at fold2, not fold1: have the sparse skip→mlv fold compute the
   round-0/1 lookahead sums in its own sweep (the resume already accepts
   `pending2` from a "fold-level lookahead" caller), so the tail's first
   pass is a 4→1 fold. That removes the +16% entry pass entirely.
Prize on the 48 ms MT tail: ~−10 ms with a fold1 entry (measured −20%),
~−15 ms with a fold-level entry; ST ~−80 ms once the entry pass is gone.
Cost: a real build (three pieces above), ~2% of the prove. Not started.

### Design notes for the prefix fold2-cascade tail, from the challenge tree — 2026-09-01

The revised lever ("enter at fold2 by forming the next rounds' lookahead
aggregates in the producing sweep") is what the challenge tree already
does, one round earlier in its numbering: its round-2 sweep forms
round-3's lookahead aggregates while the group's outputs are still in
registers (`fold_round2_compact_chunk_neon_lookahead_8`,
multilinear/kernels/aarch64.rs:791 in that tree), and the cascade
variants repeat the trick one level deeper (round-4 pairs visited four at
a time so the six deferred round-5 aggregates form in-register, :1096) —
the "composed 5+6 / 7+8 / 9+10 / 11+12" markers. So the ~10–15 ms MT bet
is de-risked structurally; the layout question (prefix interval) remains
ours to answer.

Three details that make it pay, to steal when building it:

1. **One weight per group, one scaling per row.** With r' = r_next[1]:
   eq4(2y') = (1+r')·eq5(y') and eq4(2y'+1) = r'·eq5(y'), so the whole
   group accumulates against the single odd-lane weight w = eq_lo[2t+1].
   Pre-scale the four A outputs by w with four REDUCED multiplies, then
   all eight lookahead products cost one UNREDUCED multiply each. The
   constant rescalings (κ = (1+r')/r' on the even sums, r'^-1 on the six
   deferred aggregates) are applied once by the driver, off the hot path.
   If a fold2 kernel carries a per-term eq weight into each product, this
   is where the multiplies go — and it is the same eq-factoring that our
   own `SplitEqGhash` does at the lo/hi level, pushed one level further.
2. **Don't pre-combine the parities.** Keep the even/odd halves split
   when a producing pass hands off; XOR-ing them first forces the
   consumer to recompute the odd half for the lookahead's W1/W2. Costs the
   producer nothing, drops two of the eight products: 32 PMULL per group
   instead of 38.
3. **Group-level `b ≡ 1` shortcut.** When all four b outputs are ONE,
   every difference product vanishes (b0+b1 = b2+b3 = 0) and only three
   survive — three unreduced multiplies for the group; mixed groups take
   the full path, value-identical. Worth checking how much of our b is
   structurally one at tail depth (round 1 of the URM sees 22 of 256 all-
   ones K-rows; after folding by random challenges that structure is
   gone, so this likely only helps the first tail round — measure before
   building).

Cross-tree caveat they attached and I agree with: none of this is shown
to transfer to a prefix-interval layout; the structural part ("enter at
fold2, form aggregates in the producing sweep") is layout-independent
and is exactly what the per-pass split says is the win.

### LANDED (marginal): lookahead ladder on the sparse tail's prefix — −4.5 ms MT — 2026-09-01

Built the prefix fold2-cascade ladder in `mlv_tail_fs_sparse`, in three
measured steps:

1. `lookahead_pass!` (fold1/fold2_lookahead_into) generalized to a PREFIX:
   eq tables sized from `rest` (the challenge suffix), iteration bounded
   by `a.len()`, partial last chunk safe. Full-domain callers unchanged —
   kernel tests, RS m6 transcript pins, AG roundtrips, both m=32 routes
   verify.
2. The ladder itself, mirroring `mlv_tail_fs_resume`'s lookahead branch
   on the compact buffer when the live layout is a single prefix interval
   (the shipped shape), with the `pending2` invariant carried into the
   dense resume at handoff. Transcript-identical (roundtrips with debug
   assertions, sparse-tail tests, m=32 verify both ways). One real bug
   found by the sha2 roundtrip: `fold_in_place_pair` asserted a power-of-
   two length and the in-loop resolve runs on a non-pow2 prefix — the body
   is exact for any even length, assert relaxed.
3. "One scaling per row" (Yukon): pre-scale the four `a` values by eq
   (4 reduced) so the 8 products carry the weight as single unreduced
   multiplies — 16 → 12 per position. Bit-identical by bilinearity. ST:
   fold1-la 256.7 → 239.4 (−6.7%), fold2-la 94.7 → 91.2 (−4%), exactly
   what the PMULL count predicts (−32 unreduced + 24 reduced). Yukon's
   further "one weight per GROUP" (κ) trick does NOT map here: their
   group has 2 a-values per position so one weight spans two; ours has 4
   per position and every product needs all four pre-scaled — 4 per
   position is already the minimum.

Per-pass, prefix ladder vs classic (ST, stable): fold1-la entry 239 vs
classic r1 207 (+16%); fold2-la 91 vs r2+r3 112 (−19%); fold2-la 19.6 vs
r4+r5 24.9 (−21%). The steady passes pay, the entry pass does not, and
the entry is the biggest round.

MEASURED, tail total, MT default pool, alternating, min of warm proves:
**−4.86 / −4.54 / +0.36 ms, median −4.5 ms, ladder 2/3** (on a ~67 ms
tail inflated by residual system load — macOS's on-device inference
service, not Yukon). ST: wash (357 vs 351). ~0.5% of the prove: real,
marginal, kept because it is bit-identical, ~90 lines, and the platform
the fold-level entry stands on.

The fold-level entry (form the round-0/1 lookahead sums inside the
skip→mlv fold so the tail enters at fold2) is the remaining win: it
turns the +16% entry pass into a −19% fold2 pass over 48M. Sized: tail
passes −22 ms MT, MINUS whatever the extra 8-product accumulation costs
inside the fold (per block: 32 quads × 12 multiplies against the
current round-0 message's ~128 + Horner shifts → roughly +2 multiplies
per output, ≈ +10 MT if compute-bound, less if the fold stays gather-
bound). Net ~−12 ms MT with wide error bars — so it gets a cost PROBE
inside the fold before any build.

### The fold-level entry, PRICED and refuted: +19 ms MT in the fold vs −22 in the tail — 2026-09-01

The ladder's remaining win required forming the round-0/1 lookahead
aggregates inside the skip→mlv fold so the tail enters at fold2. Before
building it, its cost was measured with a probe inside
`fold_and_first_round_sparse`'s per-block closure: the real 32-quad
lookahead accumulation (4 reduced pre-scalings + 8 unreduced products per
quad, weighted by a 32-entry inner-eq table, eq_outer applied per block,
reduced across blocks) over the just-folded outputs while they are still
in L1, result black-boxed, messages untouched (verify unchanged).

| | fold, base | fold, +accumulation | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| MT (default pool), 3 alternating pairs | 60.6–62.7 | 80.6–82.8 | **+17.9 / +19.3 / +22.1** |
| ST | 317.8 | 499.4 | **+181.6** |

I had estimated +5–12 MT on the theory that the fold is gather-bound and
would hide ALU work; it does not — the extra ~148 M multiplies cost the
same ~1.2 ns each as in the tail kernels. Against the −22 ms MT the
ladder's passes would save by entering at fold2, the net is ~0 at MT and
+70 ms at ST. **Dead.** NEON residency (the §wideneon treatment, −16% on
round 2) could not close a 19-vs-22 gap.

So the tail is settled: the ladder with a fold1 entry (−4.5 ms MT, ST
wash) stays; the entry cannot be moved into the fold; the general
kernel's NEON residency (~−8 ms MT) remains the last kernel-level item.
Probe removed; `lookahead_accum` back to private.

### Commit attributed: NTT 98 + merkle 116 + lane fill 18 — at the hash roofline for rate 1/4 — 2026-09-01

`FLOCK_COMMIT_TIMING=1`, m=32, warm prove 2: lane fill 17.66, ntt 98.44,
merkle 116.45, commit total 232.59 ms. L0 is the Fast profile's rate 1/4
(`log_inv_rate = 2`), so the L0 codeword is 2^27 F128 = 2 GB.

- NTT: 2 GB in 98 ms = 0.73 ns/element. The challenge tree's L0 encode is
  175.6 ms for 2^26 (rate 1/2) = 2.6 ns/element — ours is ~3.5× faster
  per element. Roughly 2.5 full passes over 2 GB at ~50 GB/s.
- Merkle: 2 GB hashed in 116 ms = 17 GB/s. The doc's two-state BLAKE3
  kernel does 2.3–2.4 GB/s per core; 8 P-cores = 19 GB/s. ~90% of the
  hash roofline. Yukon's merkle is 49.7 ms for 1 GB = 20 GB/s — same
  rate, half the bytes.
- Lane fill 17.7 (tiled earlier today, −31% ST).

So our commit costs ~232 vs their ~145 pure because it encodes 4× and
hashes 2× the bytes for the same message — the rate, i.e. protocol.
Nothing here clears the bloat bar as implementation: the streaming
commit / leaf-pipelining idea measured null on this tree before
(memory: 6/12, parked), four-layer NTT fusion spills (+19–26%), and
hashing less is a security decision, not mine.

### Thread pools, and the all-core (P+E) experiments: fold marginal-and-fragile, ladder worse, lincheck null — 2026-09-01

FACTS (flock-core/src/lib.rs): the global rayon pool is `init_perf_thread_pool`
= P-cores only (8 threads, 8 MB stacks); a separate `all_core_pool()`
(10 threads) exists for flat parallel-fors with many small independent
items and one join, where work-stealing drains around the slow E-cores
(its documented win: the open's combine −29% on 4P+4E). Sites hop to it
behind `ecore_rich_topology()` = `2·E ≥ P`, which is FALSE on this 8P+2E
M1 Max; `FLOCK_ALLCORE=1` forces the gate. So "fold 1 scales 5.2×" is 65%
efficiency on 8 P-threads, not E-core dilution — that hypothesis is dead.
Also explains the `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=8` trap: it disables
`init_perf_thread_pool` AND shrinks the all-core pool to 8.

Three flat-shaped phases tried on the all-core pool, same binary, env
knobs, MT warm-min, alternating:
- skip→mlv fold (376k independent 128-slot blocks): −2.27 / −2.53 /
  −2.54 / **+9.24**. The outlier landed exactly when external load
  appeared (load avg 3.3 → 6.8): under contention the E-cores become
  stragglers at the join. −2.4 ms (0.3%) with that tail risk is below
  the bar. Not kept.
- tail ladder passes (thousands of chunks, 8-accumulator reduce per
  chunk): **+1.89 / +4.59** — worse. The reduce-heavy shape is the
  doc's straggler case. Dead.
- lincheck (`FLOCK_ALLCORE=1`, the stripe fold's gated hop): the one
  quiet pair +1.11 (null); two more pairs ran under a load spike
  (absolutes 199 → 246–269) and are unreadable. Consistent with the
  gate's design. Dead on this topology.

All knobs removed; ag_skip.rs is exactly the committed ladder.

### Cross-tree NTT resolved, an E-core design worth parking, and a thermal caveat — 2026-09-01 (close of the unattended session)

NTT per element-update, both trees on the same M1 Max. Ours: 128 lanes
(the union's chunk-columns, inferred from the jagged trace), 92 live,
per-sub-NTT 2^20 at k_code = 20, layers 2..20 (the replicate-fill
pre-applies the rate layers) → 92·2^20·18 = 1.74e9 updates in 98.4 ms =
**0.057 ns/update** (0.067 on their denominator, which includes the
fill). Theirs: 0.138. The apparent 3.5× per-output-element decomposes
as ~1.39× live-column skipping (ours, structural — their commit
transforms every column) × ~2.1× that Yukon traced on their side: their
`butterfly_fused_4layer_row` is gated x86_64+avx512+vpclmulqdq with NO
aarch64 arm, so on Apple silicon it falls to portable scalar — the doc's
"four-layer NTT fusion (+19–26%)" entry is an x86-only win. Their basis
is LCH novel-polynomial over F_{2^128} (binius64-derived) with general
F128 twiddles, plus zero-root/low-twiddle XOR-only fused kernels — so
"cheap subfield early layers" was NOT the difference; I retract that
guess. Net: no NTT implementation gap on OUR side to chase.

E-CORES, the design that works for them and why ours didn't: a SEPARATE
pool at QOS_CLASS_UTILITY draining a SHARED ATOMIC CHUNK QUEUE that the
P pool also pulls from — no barrier, an E-core owns at most one tail
chunk when the P-cores finish, byte-identical by construction. Their
measured E-core share: 5–16% of fold8 blocks (a tail absorber, not a
multiplier), and their own history records the same regression we
measured when E-cores are folded into the main pool. Our tree already
has the scaffolding (`set_utility_qos`, the `pull()`/scope pattern in
lib.rs used by the merkle top). PARKED: applying it to the skip→mlv
fold (376k independent blocks) is ~30 lines with an expected −2 to −4
ms (the all-core hop measured −2.4 before it straggled) — below the bar
on its own; worth doing only as part of a wider E-core pass over witgen
+ fold + lane fill (~8 ms combined ceiling on 8P+2E).

THERMAL CAVEAT on the closing headline: after ~3.5 h of continuous
benchmarking the machine is throttled — `best prove_fast` reads 964–987
ms with verify at 9.6 ms against its normal 6.2, even at a 1-minute load
under 3 (5-minute average 5.4; iTerm at 31% from trace output). **Do not
record those as the state.** The last clean headline is 851 ms (AG
promotion pair, cool machine); every win today was established by
paired same-binary deltas, which do not depend on absolutes. Re-baseline
cold before quoting a number.

### CORRECTION to the NTT decomposition above — same basis on both trees; the ~2× is unexplained — 2026-09-01

Two errors in the previous entry, one mine and one relayed:
1. "1.39× live-column skipping" is NOT a factor: my 0.057 ns/update
   already counts only the 92 live columns, so liveness is netted out.
   Like-for-like, we execute 1.736e9 updates in 98.4 ms against their
   1.275e9 in 175.6 — 1.36× MORE updates in 0.56× the time. The whole
   gap is per-update: **2.43× on our denominator, 2.06× on theirs**
   (98.4 + 17.7 fill vs their 175.6 which includes replicate-fill).
2. Yukon's "4-layer fused butterfly falls to scalar on aarch64" is
   retracted by them: the scheduling gate selects the NEON fused-3 path
   on ARM; the scalar kernel is dead code there. And radix-16 is a
   cache-associativity wall on this microarchitecture (16 row streams
   into an 8-way L1D), not a missing port.

That left "our tower basis's cheap subfield early layers" as the
explanation by elimination — and OUR SOURCE REFUTES IT TOO:
`crates/flock-core/src/ntt/additive_ntt_f128.rs` carries the same
Irreducible/binius64 header as theirs — LCH novel polynomial basis over
F_{2^128}, `NeighborsLastReference` skeleton, general twiddles
`Ŵ_{ℓ-l-1}(z)`, the same XOR-only zero-root replica block, fused
2-/3-layer NEON butterflies. Same algorithm family, both derived from
the same reference. No subfield early layers here either.

So the ~2× per element-update between two implementations of the same
LCH NTT on the same machine is REAL and UNEXPLAINED. Candidates, none
verified: (a) lane count — ours runs 128 interleaved sub-NTTs of 2^20,
theirs 64 of 2^20, and the SoA butterfly's streaming/vectorization
width follows the lane count; (b) kernel tuning — the fused-3 NEON
kernels are each tree's own work on the shared skeleton; (c) counting —
which layers each tree's fused kernels cover per pass. It is the
largest cross-tree implementation delta either side found today, and it
favors THIS tree, so it is not an action item here; it is one for the
challenge tree, where a like-for-like kernel comparison would start
from (a).

Addendum (Yukon, closing): candidate (a) is theirs to run, as a
DIAGNOSTIC — their `log_batch_size = 6` (64 lanes) is part of the
committed PcsParams and the ranked harness gates on it, so a 128-lane run
changes the commitment, not just the kernel. If the streaming width turns
out to be the difference, their fix has to come from restructuring the
kernel at 64 lanes. Also recorded: the "tower basis" claim originated as
my hypothesis, was promoted to a conclusion on their side without a
source check, and was caught by reading our header — the same failure
mode as the friendly-kernel claim in the other direction. Verify from
source before recording an explanation, in either direction.

### LANDED: fold-level lookahead entry — the sparse tail enters at fold2 — −10 ms MT, −12 ST — 2026-09-02

Benedikt pushed back on the "fold-level entry is dead" verdict ("I
fundamentally think there should be a lot to gain here") and was right,
because the probe that condemned it was wrong in one specific way: it
ADDED the eight-product lookahead accumulation on top of the fold's
existing round-0 Horner message. In a fused fold the sums REPLACE that
message (round 0 falls out of them via `lookahead_msg_first`), so the
fair cost is the difference. Measured in stages, each gated:

1. Replacement probe (scalar `lookahead_accum` on the folded outputs,
   `s1/s_inf` gone): fold **+10.5 ms MT** (+10.8/+10.3) and +98 ST —
   half the add-on probe's +19/+182. Oracle: m=32 verifies with the
   sums-derived round-0 message; all AG roundtrips pass.
2. NEON-resident formation (`fold_block_at_la_neon`: byte-dots stay in
   q-registers off `fold_row_q_neon`, four `mul_q` pre-scalings by the
   quad's eq weight, eight `wide_mul_unreduced_q` into `WideNeon`
   accumulators): fold cost **+5 ms** (67.4 vs 62–64 classic, vs 70 for
   the scalar form).
3. The entry: `fold_and_first_round_sparse` returns the sums;
   `mlv_tail_fs_sparse` derives round 1's message at ρ₀ via
   `lookahead_msg_second`, samples ρ₁, and starts the ladder at round 2
   with `pending2 = Some(ρ₁)` — the tail's first pass is a fold2 over the
   full 48M, no fold1 entry pass. Tail 62 → 45–47 in the same
   conditions.

fold+tail, MT, alternating, warm min, same binary (knob), on a
partially loaded machine (load 3–6): scalar entry −11.7 / −7.5 / −9.8;
NEON entry **−10.0 / −11.1 / −21.1** (the −21 is a contended classic
arm). ST: **−11.9**. Call it −10 ms MT, ~1.2% of the prove, on top of
the ladder's −4.5. Transcript-identical: m=32 verifies on both routes,
RS m6 pins unchanged, roundtrips in release and with debug assertions.

One bug caught by the suite, worth recording: `sparse_tail_matches_
dense_at_low_utilization` failed because the ladder's resolve branch
set `store` to a single prefix interval — previously safe, since
`pending2` could only be `Some` after a lookahead pass, which required a
prefix. The fold-level entry starts with a deferred challenge before
any prefix is established, so on a multi-interval layout the resolve
must halve every interval instead. Fixed; the in-place pairwise fold
itself never straddles an interval (128-aligned).

Now the default on the sparse route (NEON on aarch64+aes, scalar
elsewhere; the dense folds keep the Horner message). The earlier
"fold-level entry: DEAD" entry above stands as a record of a probe that
measured the wrong thing — the lesson is "replace, don't add" when
pricing a fusion.

### Hiding round 1 under the commit: not here — but AG round 1 was leaving the E-cores idle — 2026-09-02

Benedikt asked whether AG round 1's work could hide under the commit as
the pre-merge RS prep did, and whether the E-cores could take it. The
answer splits:

HOISTING UNDER THE COMMIT — no gain available on this box. AG round 1
is in fact MORE hoistable than RS's in principle (no in-round challenge:
the per-block 160-vector and C banks depend only on the witness, and
`r_outer` enters only as the eq weight at the accumulate), but the
commit window has no idle capacity to hoist INTO: the NTT is at ~50 GB/s
and its top tiles already run P+E via `run_hetero_chunks`; the merkle is
at the hash roofline and hops to the all-core pool (`merkle.rs:663`).
The RS AB-hoist measured zero-sum here for the same reason. Hoisting
would also have to materialize ~0.4–1 GB of eq-independent partials and
drain them after `r_outer`. Not built.

USING THE E-CORES DURING ROUND 1 — yes, and it was a gap. The "round-1
E-core hetero drain" the merge audit listed as live is the RS round 1
(`univariate_skip_optimized.rs:1226`); AG round 1 ran a plain rayon
`into_par_iter` on the 8 P-cores with the 2 E-cores idle for ~49 ms.
`round1_slp_packed_banks_fused_padded` now runs its chunk loop through
`run_hetero_chunks_stateful` — P workers plus two utility-QoS E-threads
pulling from one atomic counter, per-worker sums merged after — with
chunks 4× finer (32/thread) so an E-core's last chunk cannot hold the
join. Fiat-Shamir untouched, bit-identical up to XOR order.

Measured at m=32, round-1 line, MT, alternating, warm min, same binary:
**−2.73 / −2.77 / −4.64 ms, 3/3** (the E-cores absorb ~6% of the block
work). ~0.35% of the prove — below the bar on its own, kept because it
is ~15 lines on existing infrastructure with no new code path, and it
restores what the pre-merge RS round 1 had. Verify passes on both
routes; genus95 + sparse-tail tests and AG roundtrips pass; 637/637.

Same primitive, same shape, not yet applied: the skip→mlv fold's
376k-block loop (the all-core POOL hop measured −2.4 but straggled under
load; the shared queue has no barrier) and witgen's group loop. ~−2 to
−3 ms each, next if wanted.

### Shared hetero queue on the skip→mlv fold: +24 ms, 3/3 — E-cores only help compute-bound phases — 2026-09-02

Same primitive that landed on round 1 (−2.8), applied to the fold's
376k-block loop: P workers + two utility-QoS E-threads pulling 320
chunks of ~1.2k blocks from one atomic counter, per-worker lookahead
sums merged after; the P-only arm restructured identically (raw-pointer
block writes, rayon map/reduce) so the A/B isolates the schedule.

| fold, MT, warm min | hetero | P-only | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pair 1 | 94.14 | 69.56 | +24.58 |
| pair 2 | 92.25 | 68.97 | +23.28 |
| pair 3 | 94.39 | 71.15 | +23.24 |

Verify passes (correct), and it is a third SLOWER. Straggle cannot
explain it (a chunk is ~1 ms P / ~3 ms E). The difference from round 1
is what the phase is bound by: round 1 is PMULL-bound (E-cores add ALU),
the fold is a 1 GB gather + 1.5 GB NT-store stream at ~the bus, and two
slow extra writers into a saturated memory system cost far more than the
~6% of work they take — the doc's "bandwidth-on-bandwidth" null (stripe
transpose on E-cores during the commit), measured here for the fold.
Reverted. Witgen (NT stores at roofline) is the same shape and was not
built on that basis; if anyone wants the number, the primitive is a
15-line drop-in.

RULE, now with three data points (round 1 −2.8, fold +24, all-core
pool hops earlier): on 8P+2E the E-cores pay only on compute-bound
flat loops with a barrier-free queue; never on a phase at the bus.

### LANDED: witgen flushes 1 KB column bursts instead of 128-byte scatters — −12 ms ST, −3 to −6 ms MT — 2026-09-02

Came out of Benedikt's "can commit and round 1 share one pass" question:
they cannot (different inputs, a challenge between them), but reading
the commit's lane fill next to witgen's flush exposed a store-pattern
gap. The fill writes 2 GB + reads 0.5 GB in 17.7 ms — ~140 GB/s — while
`flush_rows_nt` wrote 1.5 GB in 25.7 ms — 58 GB/s — on the same bus.
The 58 was never the NT-store roofline; it was the roofline for
92 scattered 128-byte stores per group at a 4 MB column stride (one per
page). The layout cannot change (the open and the zerocheck kernels want
column-major, and moving z into the codeword's position-major order
would change the fold's variable order = the transcript), but the burst
length can.

`drive_witness_batch_major_partial_into` now stages WG = 8 consecutive
groups (64 rows) per task and flushes each chunk-column as ONE
contiguous 1 KB burst (`flush_rows_nt_burst`); the builder, dead-lane
zeroing and the stripe are unchanged per group. Same words to the same
addresses — `batch_major_partial_zeroes_dummy_rows` (which compares
against the full generator word for word), the poison guard, the AG
roundtrips, m6 pins and m=32 verify all pass.

Measured, same binary, `FLOCK_WITGEN_GROUPS` knob, m=32:

| | WG=1 (old) | WG=2 | WG=4 | WG=8 | WG=16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ST micro-bench | 351.6 | 339.1 | 340.5 | **339.4** | 353.2 |
| in-prove witgen MT (pairs, Δ vs WG=1) | — | −3.1 / −1.7 | +4.8 / −2.1 | **−4.7 / −2.7** | −6.6 / −1.2 / −5.7 |

The ST knee is clean: 96–384 KB of staging (WG 2–8) is a −12 ms win;
768 KB (WG 16) spills L2 and gives it back. MT is noisy on a loaded
machine (load 4–6 throughout) but negative at every WG ≥ 2 bar one
pair; WG = 8 is the most consistent at MT and at the ST optimum. Kept
at 8. The standalone micro-bench at MT was a wash-to-worse for WG 16
(median +4) while the in-prove line was −5.7 3/3 — the production
path (pooled, warm, `dead_padding_unread`) is the number that counts,
and the burst is where its store traffic goes.

Remaining witgen at m=32 after this: ~26 → ~15 ms of stores, ~18 BLAKE3
compute, ~13 stripe_from_rows, ~5 z memset, ~6 row fill. The stripe's
own writes are already group-major and contiguous.

### PRICED, NOT BUILT: witgen computes the challenge-free half of round 1 — negative — 2026-09-02

Benedikt's follow-up to the one-pass question: the walker builds a and b
as it goes, and round 1's per-block product-code work does not depend on
the zerocheck challenge (only the outer eq weight does), so witgen could
compute that part, write it, and a post-challenge pass could form the
message from the stored data — "maybe more writing and reading but better
streaming". Three facts kill it on this box:

**1. Round 1's reads are not exposed (measured).** Throwaway probe: the
production padded kernel on the m=32 shape streamed from DRAM vs looped
over a cache-resident window with the same live block count:

| | ms per m=32 |
|---|---:|
| streamed, 1.2 GB from DRAM | 46.4 (25 GB/s) |
| resident 96 MB window ×11 | 48.7 |
| resident 24 MB window ×46 | 55.5 |
| resident 6 MB window ×184 | 77.9 |

Resident is never faster; the small-window arms are slower by the
per-call join (≈0.17–0.2 ms × calls, the E-thread tail). Round 1 is
compute-bound at a quarter of the bus. Moving its SLP into witgen
relocates compute and saves no memory time.

**2. The challenge-free intermediate is bigger than the inputs.** Per
1024-byte block: `af∧bf` is 160 evaluation points × 128 lanes = 2560 B,
the transposed C banks 1024 B — 3584 B vs the 3072 B of a+b+c it would
replace (the code's rate is 64→160). Live: 1.35 GB written into a
witgen that is already store-bound (+10–13 ms) and read back by the
post-challenge accumulate pass (+the 288 unreduced muls/block that stay
there anyway).

**3. a and b must still cross the ρ₀ wall in full.** The skip→mlv fold
is a ρ₀-dependent linear functional of the raw words, so the
intermediate cannot replace them. Variants that drop the a/b writes by
replaying the walker (a = A·z) need two replays (round 1 + fold) at
≤ 17.8 ms each against ≤ 17 ms of savings (a/b stores ~10, fold's a/b
read ~7); the replay-in-fold-only hybrid nets `X − 3` for a replay cost
X. Nothing here is positive without the a/b derivation being under
half the builder, which would need builder surgery to even measure.

The streaming picture that comes out of this: everything before ρ₀
(witgen, commit, round 1) is compute-bound; everything after it (fold,
tail) is bandwidth-bound; and the data crossing the wall is the raw
witness because the fold's functional depends on ρ₀. The commit/round-1
fusion and the witgen/round-1 fusion both fail for the same reason —
there is no exposed memory time on the near side of the wall to hide.

### REFUTED: interleaving witgen's stores with compute — pipelined flush BUILT, bit-identical, no gain — 2026-09-02

Benedikt's objection to the fusion verdict above: reads, compute and
writes can be interleaved, so the bound is exposed memory time, not
bytes moved. Right — so the two quantities that bound it were measured
(throwaway knobs, m=32, MT, box at load 5–13 from macOS indexing
throughout, so absolutes are inflated and only paired deltas count):

**Round 1 splits 38.5 / 8.** Skipping the eq-weighted accumulate (both
the 160 AB `mul_acc_unred` and the 128 C-bank ones, ANDs kept live):
46.6/47.2 → 39.0/40.7 ms. The SLP + transposes + ANDs — the part that
could move into witgen — are 38.5 ms; the challenge-dependent
accumulate that must stay is ~8 ms of compute, under the ~13 ms it
would take to re-read the 1.35 GB intermediate. A post-challenge pass
would be memory-bound at ~13.

**Witgen's stores ARE exposed: 12–18 ms.** Same instruction stream with
the NT bursts redirected into a 16384-row window (SLC-resident):
110.7→95.7, 105.2→93.3, 102.1→83.6 ms (micro-bench, 3/3). So the
DRAM-destined stores cost ~15 ms that the core does not hide under its
own compute today.

Ideal-overlap bound for the witgen-computes-round-1 scheme, using
those: today `W + 46.5`; scheme `W − 15 + 38.5 + 13 = W + 36.5` →
−10 ms at best, requiring all 2.85 GB of stores to hide under witgen's
compute and a large restructure (round-1 kernel hosted in the
super-group loop, +1.35 GB footprint, partial-block cleansing moved).

**The cheapest test of the thesis was built instead:** a
software-pipelined flush inside witgen — double-buffered staging, the
previous super-group's 1 KB column bursts issued one column slice per
group in between this super-group's BLAKE3 builds, the last set
flushed from the worker state's `Drop`. Bit-identical (dummy-rows
contract both arms, poison guard). Measured, same binary, knob:

| | pipelined | unpipelined (shipped) |
|---|---|---|
| ST micro (best) | 328.9 / 328.6 / 356.8 | 333.9 / 339.5 / 323.2 |
| MT micro (best), 6 pairs | 3/6 negative | — |
| in-prove witgen, WG=8, 4 pairs | 44.9 / 43.2 / 45.9 / 42.6 | 43.3 / 49.9 / 44.1 / 51.7 |
| in-prove witgen, WG=4 (393 KB staging), 3 pairs | 47.4 / 49.8 / 48.9 | 46.8 / 50.4 / 51.1 |

2/4 and 2/3 on the in-prove line, medians −3 and −0.7, totals worse or
noise. Reverted: ~60 lines of double-buffer machinery for an effect
that does not clear the noise floor is under the bloat bar. The
reading: the ~15 ms is the memory system absorbing 8 cores' NT bursts,
not a shortage of independent work in the instruction window —
reordering the issue stream at group granularity, at two staging
sizes, changes nothing. That is the same slack the fusion scheme would
need to hide 1.35 GB more under, so the scheme stays refuted.

Side result: in-prove witgen now reads **43–47 ms** (it was ~64 before
the dead-padding skip and the burst flush), and `[prove_union] TOTAL`
bests were 760.6–764.7 ms across these runs on a loaded box — in the
760–770 window predicted from the landed deltas.

### LANDED: the STATISTICS LADDER — open −80..−107 ms, prove −115..−138 ms (3/3), bit-identical — 2026-09-02

Benedikt asked for the open ("look at the latex, Yukon and the pre-merge
code"). Attribution first, warm MT, m=32, `PCS_TRACE` + `LIG_PROVE_TRACE`
+ a throwaway sub-bucket probe:

| open_merged 262 | ms |
|---|---:|
| W build + round-0 prime (2^25) | 36.6 (ST 247, evaluation-bound, materialized by measurement) |
| merged product sumcheck, 25 rounds | 19.5 (ST 85, bandwidth-bound) |
| combine sweep (seeded EqPoint prime + lookahead) | 46.0 (ST 332) |
| ligerito: L0 OOD sweep | 19.7 |
| ligerito: init folds + switch (fold 1 = 34–37 at 13+3T muls/output) | 62.7 |
| ligerito: recursive commits, 5 levels (L1 encode 18 + merkle 9–12) | 52 |
| ligerito: level OODs / induce / rec folds | 10.4 / 10.5 / 4.3 |

Config at m=32: log_n 25, initial_k 6, ks [4,4,4,4,4], rates
[1,3,5,7,9,11], queries [244,79,48,35,29,25], ood [1,2,2,2,2,2].

**The structure that was being paid for three times.** The L0 basis is a
sum of T = 2 rank-1 eq tensors — the seeded merged-transport point and
the one L0 OOD point — and the six initial rounds bind exactly the six
lane-block bits (`fold_block = 2^19`, pairs of blocks). Write the index
as `u = e·d + h`; each term is `s_t · blk_t[e] · within_t[h]`. Then every
L0 round message is a function of the block statistics
`G_t[e] = Σ_h f[e,h]·within_t[h]` — 64 values per term — and the six
array folds compose into one 64-term fold `f'[h] = Σ_e eq(r,e)·f[e,h]`
straight into F256. The incremental ladder instead swept the 2^25 witness
for the combine's prime+lookahead (46), swept it again for the OOD (20),
then folded it through five passes with the virtual basis evaluated per
output (63). This is the challenge tree's "direct fold" (Yukon: rounds
0..4 cost 0.13 ms there; their kill-switch A/B prices the chain at −14 MT
/ −119 ST on their open), which the regraft verdicts had filed as "dead
by protocol" because their CODE was tied to the 100-bit basis open. The
ALGEBRA is not: it needs a rank-1 basis and lane-major block rounds,
which the f256 ladder has. Re-derived, not ported.

Built (`pcs::STATS_LADDER_OVERRIDE` / `FLOCK_NO_STATS_LADDER` same-binary
knob; `extension::init_phase_statistics`): one sweep computes both terms'
statistics (2 muls/element), the OOD eval and β come from the 64-entry
tables, the round messages are `stats_round_msg` over the folded block
tables (the `(u_0,u_2)` convention with each term's rank-1 factor
hoisted: `Σ_h (f_0+f_1)(B_0+B_1) = (blk_0+blk_1)(G_0+G_1)`), the fold is
`fold_blocks_by_eq` (64 mixed F256×F128 muls per output over h-chunks),
the switch basis is `Σ_t s_t·blk_t[0]·within_t[h]`, and the existing
`code_switch_and_push_message` takes over. The combine skips its sweep
under the same gate. Same field elements in the same transcript slots,
so proof bytes are identical — `tests/stats_ladder.rs` is the oracle
(small geometry always-on; the m32 leaf as `--ignored` microbench).

Measured. m32 leaf inner open (2^25 words, 56/64 lanes, alternating
in-process arms on one committed stack): stats ladder = sweep 12 +
rounds 0.01 + fold 9 + basis 0.4 + switch 11 ≈ 34 ms vs combine 42 +
L0 OOD 21 + init folds 69 = 132 ms; open **204.6 vs 298.9 min (−94),
−91 median, proof bytes identical**. In-prove, same binary, 3 pairs:

| pair | open stats / ladder | TOTAL stats / ladder |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 162.9 / 262.1 | 630.3 / 768.2 |
| 2 | 177.8 / 257.2 | 643.5 / 758.7 |
| 3 | 161.2 / 268.0 | 636.4 / 772.3 |

**Open −80..−107, prove −115..−138 ms, 3/3; best prove 630.3 ms** (the
previous best on this box was 760.6). The TOTAL moves ~35 ms more than
the open bucket — the ladder no longer allocates fold 1's two 256 MB
F256 transients and gives the 512 MB witness back right after its one
fold, so the pool sees less churn (the non-local pool lesson, this time
in our favour); not chased further.

Certification: fold_lookahead oracle, stats_ladder oracle, prover
roundtrips, poison guard, core ligerito (73) and pcs (164) suites pass;
workspace suite, fmt, x86 check and an m=32 prove+verify below.

What remains in the open after this (warm MT, ~163): recursive commits
52 (L1 encode 18 at 7.5 G updates/s vs the main commit's 17.6 — Yukon's
L1 runs 10.1 with EIGHT lanes, so lane count is not the cause; their
reference is twiddle register residency across row tiles,
`butterfly_fused_3layer_rows` hoisting the seven twiddle loads out of
the row loop — a loop-nest change worth measuring here; their sizing
caution: radix-8 fused-3 already sits AT the M-series 8-way L1D
associativity limit (16 concurrent row streams alias into one set), so
tile the rows but never widen the radix, and pair the tiling with the
zero-root variant that keeps four twiddle registers live), W build 37,
merged sumcheck 19.5 (an alternating skip/fold2 schedule would cut its
traffic ~45%, ≈ −8 MT / −40 ST), level OODs + induce ~21 (F256
promotions of base-valued 2^20 bases: ~−6 with mixed-field kernels),
switch 11.

### LANDED: W build with the column factor baked into per-column fold tables — −7 ms MT, −60 ST — 2026-09-03

Benedikt: "there was a big win taking advantage of the eq tensor
structure during open?" — that was the statistics ladder (and, before
the merge, the virtual basis and the JIT W_rho: the same principle,
never materialize an eq tensor). The one place left where an eq tensor
was still multiplied element by element: the merged transport's weight
`W[d] = Σ_i φ_i(eq_row_i[r]·eq_col_i[c])` — per element and per RS
claim, one field multiply by the hoisted column factor, then the
16-lookup byte-table map φ_i. The column factor is constant across a
whole column segment and `x ↦ φ_i(eq_col[c]·x)` is F₂-linear, so its
byte decomposition IS a fold table: bake `Ψ_c = φ_i ∘ (eq_col[c]·)` per
column (92 live × 64 KB per claim, ~1 ms MT to build, parallel over
columns) and the slot costs the 16 lookups only.

| W build, m=32 | baked | multiply |
|---|---:|---:|
| MT (3 pairs) | 25.4 / 25.1 / 25.4 | 32.2 / 31.7 / 32.4 |
| ST (1 pair) | 166.9 | 227.1 |

Same field elements, so W and everything downstream are identical: the
m6 merged-union proof-bytes pins pass, workspace 638/0, x86 check
clean, m=32 verify passes. The probe knob and the multiply path were
deleted (the baked form is unconditional).

### REFUTED: tiled NEON radix-8 in the recursive commits' NTT — deep pass +1.0 ms, top −0.5, net loss — 2026-09-03

Yukon's L1 finding (their recursive L1 encode runs FASTER per update
than their main commit; ours 2.4× slower than ours) and their reference
— twiddles held in vector registers across a tile of rows,
`butterfly_fused_3layer_rows` — pointed at our recursive commits (52 ms,
L1 encode 16–18). Our tree already HAS that kernel (the ranked top pass
of the main commit uses it, hetero-scheduled), but the recursive commits
enter through the generic `from_layer` driver: a portable per-row-group
fused-3 top pass (one rayon item per 8 rows × 16 lanes = 2 KB) and a
fused-2 (radix-4) + single-layer deep pass over 2 MB sub-groups.

Built: the NEON tiled kernel with a `live` lane bound, used (a) in the
generic top pass as (block, tile) jobs on the hetero queue and (b) in
the deep pass wherever ≥ 3 layers remain, `zero_root` detected from the
twiddles. Measured at m=32 with a top/deep split timer, same binary,
3 pairs, L1 = log_d 19 / 16 lanes / start layer 3 / n_top 6:

| L1 | radix-8 | shipped |
|---|---|---|
| top pass (layers 3–5) | 2.48 / 2.58 / 2.55 | 3.01 / 3.17 / 2.79 |
| deep pass (13 layers) | 12.93 / 12.88 / 12.88 | 11.93 / 11.84 / 11.86 |
| L1 encode | 16.90 / 16.95 / 17.03 | 16.42 / 16.61 / 16.27 |

L2 (1/32) 7.1 vs 6.5–7.3, L3 (1/128) 2.95 vs 3.0–4.0: wash. The main
commit never enters this driver (it takes `from_message`), so nothing
moved there. Reverted. Reading: at 16 lanes a row is 256 B = 4 lines,
and the radix-8 deep chain keeps 8 row streams live whose strides are
multiples of the L1 set period — 32 lines contending for 8 ways, the
wall Yukon's tree documents ("radix-8 is the widest fusion that fits";
here it does not, at this lane width, in L2-resident sub-groups). The
top pass gains from tiling/hetero but is only 3 ms. Yukon's own L1 at
8 lanes runs 10.1 G updates/s to our 7.5 with a different layer
schedule (`from_message_fused3` writing the first radix-8 result
straight from the compact message); that is a from_message path for
the recursive levels, a larger port, parked. Lane count is not the
cause (their 8 lanes beat our 16).

### REFUTED: alternating skip/double-fold schedule on the merged product sumcheck — 2026-09-03

The L0 ladder's schedule (skip a round via lookahead coefficients,
then fold two challenges in one pass) applied to the transport's
25-round product sumcheck `Σ_d q[d]·W[d]` (19.5 MT / 85 ST; ~45% less
traffic on paper). Built twice, both byte-identical (m6 pins, the
lookahead and stats oracles, pcs suite), both measured against the
saved baseline binary, alternating, 3 MT pairs + 1 ST pair:

| | merged SC MT | W build MT | merged SC ST | W build ST |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 17.9 / 17.9 / 17.7 | 25.0 / 25.0 / 25.1 | 81.6 | 166.4 |
| A: round-1 lookahead fused into the W build | 11.6 / 12.1 / 11.4 | 29.8 / 30.8 / 29.2 | 79.0 | 205.9 |
| B: entry at a round-0 fold+lookahead pass | 16.2 / 16.1 / 16.0 | 24.6 / 24.7 / 26.0 | 107.7 | 168.1 |

A: −6.2 on the sumcheck but +5.0 on the evaluation-bound W build (+40
ST) — net −1 MT, +37 ST. B: −1.8 MT, +26 ST. Neither clears the bar.
Mechanism: these passes are one multiply per element and already
within ~1.3× of compute-bound at MT; the lookahead's extra products
(the 8-unreduced-mul quad accumulator) tip them over, so the traffic
saved is repaid in PMULLs, and at ST it is pure loss. The zerocheck
ladder won because its per-element compute (eq-weighted products)
dwarfed the lookahead; the transport sumcheck has no such cover.
Reverted; do not retry without a cheaper lookahead.

### LANDED: mixed-field intake for the level OOD and induced bases — level OODs −5.7 MT, induce −3.3 MT (−24 / −13 ST) — 2026-09-03

The recursive levels' OOD bases (`eq(z, ·)`, 2^20 at level 1, two per
level) and the induced query basis (2^19, transported across the split
as the pairs `(B_j, 0), (0, B_j)`) are base-valued, and so is the table
`f` they meet — every level's OOD and induce run right after a code
switch, on the split coordinate words. The intake nevertheless promoted
each basis to F256 (a 32 MB allocation and write), formed the round
message with F256×F256 products (three F128 multiplies each), split the
induced basis into a second 64 MB array, and glued with F256×F128
products into both limbs. Sub-bucket probe: OOD introduce 6.4, induce
introduce 2.8, glue 3.4 ms MT — and these three scaled only ~3.5× ST→MT
(page faults on the fresh 32–64 MB promotions).

Now (`PendingBasis::{Base, PresplitBase}`): the OOD evaluation and its
`(u_0, u_2)` are three F128 products per pair in one sweep; the
presplit message is `u_0 = Σ f_0·B_j`, `u_2 = (S, S)` with
`S = Σ (f_0+f_1)·B_j` (two products per pair, since `u·B = (0, B)` and
`(1+u)·s = (s, s)` for base `s`); glue adds `B_j·β` into `c0` (Base) or
into `c0` of the even slot and `c1` of the odd slot (PresplitBase).
Same field elements, no promotion, no split array. Alternating against
the saved baseline binary, m=32, warm min:

| | level OODs | induce |
|---|---|---|
| MT new / base (3 pairs) | 5.6 / 4.7 / 4.6 vs 10.3 / 10.6 / 10.4 | 7.3 / 6.9 / 7.0 vs 11.0 / 10.0 / 10.0 |
| ST new / base | 11.7 vs 35.9 | 23.0 vs 36.2 |

Open (pairs 2–3) −17 / −16 ms; **best prove 601.4 ms**. Bit-identical:
m6 merged-union proof-bytes pins, prover roundtrips, core pcs suite,
the stats-ladder and fold-lookahead oracles. The promoted intake
(`introduce_extension`) is deleted.

### LANDED: the L0 Merkle was hashing every leaf on the generic path — merkle 116 → 39 ms MT, commit −78, prove −67..−90 — 2026-09-03

Benedikt: "commit + zerocheck + lincheck should be cheaper now than
before, because the AG skip is so much better — investigate." The
investigation went through the 09-01 commit attribution, which had
declared the merkle "at the hash roofline for rate 1/4, 2 GB". The
L0 rate is 1/2 (`Blake3Setup::new` → `log_inv_rate 1`; the ligerito
config's `log_inv_rates[0] = 1`), so the codeword is 2^26 F128 = 1 GB
and 116 ms is 8.6 GB/s — HALF the roofline that entry itself quoted
(2.3–2.4 GB/s per core), and half Yukon's 20 GB/s.

Cause: `blake3_hash_many_leaves` dispatched the 8-way NEON kernel only
for leaf sizes 64/128/256/512/1024 ("leaf sizes are `16 << log_batch_
size`, so only powers of two arise" — true before the integer-lane
commit). The union commits `commit_lanes` = 46 lanes at m=32, so the
leaf is 736 bytes, and every one of the 2^20 leaves went to the generic
per-leaf `blake3::Hasher` (parallel across leaves, single-stream
inside). Fix: the kernel takes the last block's true length (a short
final block is zero-padded, as BLAKE3 specifies — `compress2` now takes
the block length instead of a constant 64), and the batcher accepts any
single-chunk leaf (`1..=1024`), tail leaves on the generic path. Same
chunk CVs, same roots.

| m=32 | new | base |
|---|---|---|
| merkle MT (3 pairs) | 39.8 / 39.2 / 39.3 | 116.7 / 121.1 / 115.6 |
| commit MT | 154.4 / 146.1 / 150.2 | 232.9 / 229.9 / 222.3 |
| prove TOTAL MT | 583.8 / 554.4 / 540.4 | 651.1 / 643.5 / 625.7 |
| merkle / commit / total ST | 314 / 1008 / 3206 | 941 / 1640 / 3938 |

Yukon's correction on the bytes: the integer-lane L0 codeword stores
only the 46 live lanes — 46 × 2^20 × 16 B = 736 MiB, not 1 GB — so the
old merkle ran at 6.3 GB/s and the new one at 19.8 GB/s on the all-core
pool, the same rate as theirs (21.6). **Best prove 540.4 ms under load
17** — the previous best was 601. Certified: 24 merkle unit
tests including the new sizes (1, 16, 32, 48, 63, 100, 736, 1000), m6
merged-union proof-bytes pins (roots identical), roundtrips; workspace,
fmt, x86 and m=32 verify below.

And the answer to the question: pre-merge commit + zc + lincheck was
262 + 120 + 19 = 401 (with ~130 ms of RS round-1 prep hidden under a
stall-rich commit); now it is ~150 + ~170 + ~20 = 340 — cheaper by
~60 ms, all of it from this fix. Before it, the sum was 405–415: the
AG skip's saving (RS round 1 165 ms all-in → AG 48) was cancelled by
round 1 no longer having a commit window with idle capacity to hide
in, and by the merkle running at half speed.

### E-cores, second pass: witgen and the W build join the P+E queue (−2 and −1.5 ms MT, 3/3); the statistics sweep does not — 2026-09-03

Benedikt: "can we try again to engage the efficiency cores?" The rule
from 09-01 stands (E-cores pay on compute-bound flat loops, never on
phases at the bus), and three compute-bound loops had landed since:
the statistics sweep and fused fold in the open, and the witness
builder's super-group loop; the W build (lookup-bound) was the fourth
candidate. All four went on the shared queue (`run_hetero_chunks` /
`_stateful`, two utility-QoS E-threads) behind one knob; same outputs
by construction (which worker runs a chunk cannot change its result;
dummy-rows contract, m6 pins, pcs suite pass). Two alternating runs,
3 pairs each, m=32 MT, warm min:

| bucket | on / off (run 1, all four sites) | on / off (run 2, witgen + W build only) |
|---|---|---|
| witgen | 35.6 / 38.2, 37.2 / 38.5, 34.5 / 39.0 | 34.8 / 37.4, 37.4 / 38.7, 35.9 / 38.0 |
| W build | 23.4 / 25.4, 23.3 / 25.8, 24.3 / 24.1 | 24.5 / 24.9, 23.9 / 25.7, 23.9 / 25.5 |
| stats sweep | 14.0 / 10.8, 13.3 / 10.8, 13.7 / 10.9 | (rayon) |
| fused fold | 8.6 / 8.7, 8.6 / 8.5, 8.4 / 8.6 | (rayon) |
| prove TOTAL | 564 / 543, 552 / 539, 556 / 540 | 563 / 549, 538 / 535, 540 / 545 |

Witgen −2.6/−1.3/−2.1 (6/6 across both runs) and the W build −0.4..−2.5
(5/6) are kept, knob stripped: the builder is BLAKE3 compute and the W
build is L1-table lookups, both flat. The statistics sweep LOSES
+2.5..+3.2 (3/3) — it streams 512 MB at ~47 GB/s, so two slow extra
readers on a near-saturated bus hold the join (the fold/witgen lesson
again); the fused fold is a wash. Both open sites reverted to rayon.
The TOTAL cannot resolve a −3.5 ms bucket effect at load 7–13 (run 2:
+14 / +3 / −5); run 1's +12..+21 on the total is the sweep's loss plus
noise. Kept on the same evidence standard as round 1's queue (−2.8,
3/3 on its bucket).

### Three-way, refreshed: pre-merge close vs the challenge tree vs now — 2026-09-03

Yukon's column is their verified-quiet-window warm min (±2%); ours is
today's traced run at load 6–10 (±5%; best clean total today 540).
m=32, CPU-only, grinding off.

| MT (ms) | pre-merge (08-27, old protocol) | Yukon (100-bit class, no union) | now (128-bit f256 split, union) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|

| **total** | **464.5** | **381.2 (687.7k c/s)** | **570 this run / 540 best (485k c/s)** |

| ST (ms) | pre-merge | Yukon | now |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| witness | 231 | 205 | 258 |
| commit | 1268 | 1670 (ntt 733, merkle 383, A/B 552) | 1000 (ntt 630, merkle 312) |

| open | 147 | 101 | 760 |
| **total** | **3230** | **2860** | **3149** |

Reading: single-threaded we are now under pre-merge (3149 vs 3230) on
the stronger protocol and within 10% of the challenge tree; the commit
is the cheapest of the three at both widths (their ntt is 175.6 on 1.36×
fewer element-updates — our NTT's ~2.5× per-update lead is now the
largest single kernel difference in our favour, still unexplained on
their side); zerocheck + lincheck at MT is ~165–175 clean against their
127 visible / ~210 true; the open is the whole remaining gap (144 vs
22) and is protocol: the f256 two-point-OOD split with per-level OOD
binding and the union transport, whose five recursive commits alone
(48.5) exceed their entire open. Ratios on the best total: 1.16× vs
pre-merge (1.89× at merge time), 1.42× vs Yukon (2.1× at merge time).

### BLOCKED BY THE RECURSIVE VERIFIER: four-level Fast/Slim ladder — proof −12.9 KB natively, but the tower envelope cannot hold the 16× residual — 2026-09-03

From the measured proof breakdown at m=32 (462,052 B): L0 285,184
(62%), L1 55,136, L2 33,280, L3 23,424, L4 19,072, L5 16,224 (its 25
queries × (256 B row + paths) + cap, plus a 512 B residual). Dropping
a level removes its block and replaces the clear residual with the
previous level's, 16× larger per step (2^(dim+1) words: 512 B at L5,
4 KB at L4, 32 KB at L3, 256 KB at L2). Four levels: −12.1 KB
predicted, ~−3.5 ms prover (L5's commit + rounds + OODs + induce), and
a smaller verifier (−25 leaf and −275 pair hashes, −254 FS compressions
for the level's bytes, +64 for the residual; +450 residual multiplies
against −400 query-consistency ones). Three levels would be a size
wash for another ~5 ms; two levels is +203 KB. Benedikt chose four as
the default.

Where the level count lives: the security derivation
(`LigeritoSecurityConfig::derive_profile_ladder` →
`derive_ladder_shape_tuned`, stopping rule "recurse while the residual
has > 5 column bits"), baked into the embedded TOMLs
(`configs/ligerito/m{22..35}_{profile}.toml`, regenerated by
`gen_ligerito_configs`) that the prover, the native verifier AND the
tower's recursive verifier (`tower/geometry.rs`: "the allocation is
config authority, never proof-derived") all read — so one rule change
moves all three consistently. The rule is now per profile: Fast/Slim
stop at ≤ 8 residual bits; Fast100/Slim100/Secure keep 5 (Fast100 is
the frozen pre-list-decoding cost point, pinned by
`ligerito_security_config_fast100_reproduces_pre_128_schedule`), and
the legacy small-m `default_config` (the element R1CS path at
`MIN_M_WORDS = 8`, which needs ≥ 1 level) keeps 5 too. 28 TOMLs
changed (every Fast/Slim m loses exactly one level; at m=32 the ladder
is 19 → 16 → 13 → 10 → 7, residual 2^8 words). The wire format is
unchanged (same fields, shorter vectors), so proof-IO stays v22.

Built and gated: the per-profile rule, 28 regenerated TOMLs, and the
re-pins (m6 merged-union fixtures: 4 digests + the BLAKE3/SHA-256
anchors; the 7 mixed-class fixtures; the element-only transcript shape;
the m29 config test) — workspace 638/0, fmt, x86, and at m=32 **proof
449,180 B (−12,872, −2.8%)**, verify passes, prove 537 ms. Then the
tower's recursive-verifier e2e (`chain_spine_converges`, passing at
HEAD in 81 s) FAILED: "slot 6 exceeded its 2^14 row capacity". The
tower is a fixed envelope (nu = 14, every physical slot < 2^14 rows,
pinned to the m29 node's measured geometry) and its residual
consistency check is emitted per query per eight-word chunk of the
clear residual, so the residual's size multiplies MAC rows. Census
(`FILL_CENSUS=1`, node envelope, 5 → 4 levels; the probe widened nu to
15 to get the counts):

| slot | HEAD | four levels |
|---|---:|---:|
| el701 extension MAC (2^14 physical limit) | 16384 | 17158 |
| el600 base MAC | 12316 | 19816 |
| el882 eight-way residual accumulation | 742 | 5168 |
| b3 BLAKE (the dropped level's paths) | 6808 | 6413 |

The hash saving is real (b3 −395 rows) but the residual's MACs cost
~13× more rows than that, el701 was already at exactly 2^14, and at
nu = 15 a further slot overflowed. Making it fit means either nu = 15
across the envelope (mu 23 → 24: roughly 2× rows per recursion node,
far more than 12.9 KB per proof is worth) or a redesign of the in-circuit
residual consistency (evaluate the residual's encoding once per level
instead of per query). My earlier in-circuit estimate counted hashes
and missed that this circuit's per-query residual MACs dominate.
NOT LANDED. The complete change (rule, TOMLs, re-pins) is preserved as
`scratchpad/four_levels.patch` (33 files); the tree is back at HEAD.
Decision pending: revert (keep five), pay the envelope, or redesign
the residual gate.

### LANDED: the seeded term's block statistics come from the merged sumcheck — ladder sweep 10.6 → 6.6 ms MT — 2026-09-03

Benedikt: keep five levels, keep pushing the open. Under this protocol
the open's implementation floor is ~120 ms against ~144 now; this is
the largest certain piece of that slack. The inner open's claim sits
at the merged sumcheck's own point ρ (`PackedDirectClaim { point: rho,
eq_ind: EqPoint(rho) }`), in the same coordinate convention the
statistics ladder uses (coordinate j ↔ index bit j, LSB pairing), so
the merged sumcheck's folded witness after `log_n − initial_k = 19` of
its 25 rounds — the 64-entry `a` array before round 19 — IS
`Σ_h f[e,h]·eq(ρ_{0..19}, h)` per lane block: the seeded term's block
statistics, which the ladder had been sweeping the 512 MB witness a
second time to recompute. Dead blocks past the live prefix are honest
zeros of `q` (the trimmed fold never writes them), so the capture
zeroes the untouched tail. The 64 values ride
`open_batch_mixed_ligerito_seeded` → the prover impl →
`init_phase_statistics`, whose sweep then covers the OOD term alone
(one multiply per element instead of two). Exact: the same field
elements by reassociation, so proof bytes are identical (m6 pins;
the stats-ladder oracle still exercises the sweep path, which the
microbench's claim without a merged sumcheck takes).

Alternating vs the HEAD binary, m=32 MT, warm min, box at load 8–13:

| | seeded stats | HEAD |
|---|---|---|
| ladder sweep | 6.68 / 6.84 / 6.43 | 10.41 / 10.96 / 10.38 |

−3.9 ms, 3/3; the rest of the ladder (fold ~8.7, switch 5–17 under
load) and the totals are noise at this load. Workspace, fmt, x86 gates
below.

### LANDED: the code switch fused into the ladder's fold and basis — switch 7.7 → 0.7 ms MT — 2026-09-03

After the ladder's one fused fold, the code switch still ran three
conversions before its message: `split_coordinates` (2^19 F256 → 2^20
F128 words, 16 MB), the promotion back to F256 (32 MB), and
`split_basis` (2^19 → 2^20 F256, 32 MB) — each a fresh allocation and
a pass. The fold now writes its output directly in the switch's form
(`fold_blocks_by_eq_split`: the split coordinate words `(c0, 0),
(c1, 0)` at `2h, 2h+1`, promoted) and the basis is materialized already
split (`materialize_folded_basis_split`: `B'[h], u·B'[h]`), so the
switch is `round_msg_fbase` alone. Same field elements (m6 pins, the
stats oracle).

Alternating vs the seeded-statistics binary, m=32 MT, warm min, box
at load 11–15:

| | fused | HEAD |
|---|---|---|
| switch | 0.77 / 0.61 / 0.69 | 7.74 / 7.71 / 10.04 |
| fold (now writes 32 MB split) | 11.6 / 11.1 / 9.5 | 8.6 / 8.6 / 9.6 |
| basis | 0.56 / 0.56 / 0.59 | 0.43 / 0.32 / 0.54 |

Switch −7 (3/3), fold +1..+3 at this load (pair 3 a wash; the extra
16 MB of writes cannot cost 2 ms on a compute-bound pass, so most of
that is the load), net ≈ −4 on the ladder; the open bucket resolved
−0.4 / −1.0 in the two clean pairs, and the prove's best total is now
**521.2 ms**. Workspace, fmt, x86 gates below.

### REFUTED (below the bar): two transposed-NTT layers per pass in the induced-basis builder — 2026-09-03

The L0 induced basis (`induce_sumcheck_poly_via_ntt`: scatter 244 query
weights, apply the transposed additive NTT `Fᵀ` over 2^20, keep 2^19)
ran its twelve dense layers past the sparse-window prefix as twelve
passes over 16 MB. Fusing two layers per pass (inner sub-block
butterflies, then the outer across-halves butterfly, per element — the
same operation order, `induce_sumcheck_poly_via_ntt_matches_dense` and
the m6 pins byte-identical) measured, alternating vs HEAD at m=32 MT:
induce 6.73 / 6.33 / 6.71 vs 6.91 / 6.68 / 8.11 — −0.2 / −0.35 (/ −1.4
under a load spike). The array is SLC-resident and the top layers stay
single-layer anyway, so there was ~0.3 ms in it. Reverted; not worth
its 40 lines. Prove best in this run: **500.2 ms** (both arms; load
had dropped to ~8), open ~136 ms.

### LANDED: block-first merged sumcheck from column statistics (stage 1 of the direct transport) — open 137 → 109 ms MT — 2026-09-04

The merged reduction's prover side materialized the twisted weight W
over the dense cube (2^25 words, 25 ms) and ran 25 rounds on (q, W)
(21 ms). Neither is necessary when the committed stack is a
full-height column prefix (identity compaction — the union at full
utilization; `jagged::rectangular_prefix_columns`, public data):
split the dense index as (block e of two lane columns | column bit c0
| row r). Every ring-switch weight is then a sum of 256 RANK-1 terms
`c_j · u(e)^{2^j} · (eq(z_col0,c0)·eq(z_row,r))^{2^j}` (linearized Φ +
the eq tensor factoring over column bit 0 vs bits 1..6), masked to the
live prefix on the e side, and a packed-direct group is two more. The
first k−1 = 6 rounds bind the block coordinates from O(64) BLOCK
STATISTICS per term, `S_{j,c0}[e] = (eq(z_col0,c0)·Σ_b β_b^{2^-j}
T[2e+c0][b])^{2^j}`, where T is the column bit-bank
`T[c][b] = Σ_r eq(z_row,r)·bit_b(q[c,r])` — for the AB claim exactly
the lincheck's `z_vec` (free); for the C claim one more stripe fold at
the zerocheck's row point (`lincheck::union_bitbank_fold`, 12.6 ms,
outside the open). After the block rounds q is folded once over the
bound coordinates (one read of q) and W′ is written in closed form on
2^19 entries (block factor into the linearized coefficients, c0 into
per-c0 byte tables); the 19 row rounds run on (q′, W′). ρ arrives in
round order (blk, row) and is rotated into coordinate order before the
assist/inner open; the verifier (`verify_batch_merged_core`) and the
tower's replay (`child_walker.rs`: `w_coords` beside the round-order
`w_rounds`) apply the same rotation under the same predicate. Proof
size and verifier work unchanged. Doc: new §"The prover's transport:
block-first rounds from column statistics" in
`docs/capacity-free-ring-switching.tex`.

Bug found on the way (caught by `element_only_union_roundtrip`,
PcsOpen(VirtualOpen)): the scalar-group terms were unmasked past the
live prefix. The verifier's Ŵ(ρ) is the MLE of the weight that is
ZERO past the area, and the product sumcheck's messages see W at dead
columns through each fold pair's cross terms even though q vanishes
there — the mask is exact, not cosmetic. The prover's own debug oracle
(`v == w_eval`) does not catch it; only the chain does.

Costs (PCS_TRACE, m=32 MT): block statistics 3.6, block rounds + q′ +
W′ 9.5, row rounds ~1 → merged sumcheck 14 ms (was 25 + 21). Against
it: the C-claim bank fold 12.6 and the lost statistics-ladder seed
(the seeded term was the merged sumcheck's fold at 2^19 in ITS
coordinate order, which the block-first order no longer produces:
ladder sweep 6.8 → 10.7).

Alternating vs the HEAD binary (base4), m=32 MT, warm min, 3 pairs:

| pair | new open / cfold / total | HEAD open / total |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 109.5 / 12.6 / 510.8 | 137.3 / 539.4 |
| 2 | 108.8 / 12.4 / 504.1 | 136.5 / 550.6 |
| 3 | 108.2 / 12.7 / 511.1 | 136.7 / 518.5 |

Open −28 ms 3/3; net of the C fold ≈ −15 expected, totals −27 mean
(noisy at ±15). Prove best **504.1 ms**. Pins moved (full-utilization
layouts only, as predicted): `merged-anchor-blake3-m22`,
`merged-anchor-sha2-m22`, `elem-merged-nu12-full`; the partial
fixtures and the transcript shape are byte-identical. Gates: fmt
clean, workspace (release) 638 passed / 0 failed, tower e2e
`chain_tower_e2e_with_lane` (--ignored) ok with the rotation, x86
check ok.

Next (stage 2, parked): re-seed the ladder from the block-first fold
(the 2^19 q′ IS a fold of q over the top coordinates — the ladder
wants the fold over its own initial coordinates; check which six it
binds), and the full fusion (inner open at the F256 point).

### ADJUDICATED (blocked by the tower envelope, not built): stage 2 — the full fusion of the transport into the Ligerito open — 2026-09-04

Design (the "direct fold" completed): drop the merged sumcheck
entirely and make W the inner open's L0 basis. Under the rectangular
predicate W is 256 rank-1 terms per RS claim (+2 per scalar group) —
the stage-1 `(A, S)` tables — so the ladder's six F256 block rounds run
off the same statistics (`stats_round_msg` over 512 terms: ~0.5 ms),
the existing fused fold gives the level-1 witness in F256, and the
level-1 basis is W′ in F256 in closed form (byte tables with F256
weights, ~2.5 ms). The OOD term keeps its sweep. Prover ceiling from
the measured pieces: merged sumcheck 14 + ladder seed-sweep share 4 +
F128 q′ fold folded into the F256 fold → **≈ −11 ms on the open**
(109 → ~98), the assist prover disappears (it was off the critical
path), the assist proof leaves the transcript (smaller proof, cheaper
native verify).

Why it is blocked: the verifier must then evaluate Ŵ at the ladder's
F256 point (the residual pairing's `eval_b_residual`), i.e.
Σ_j c′_j·eq(z^{2^j}, σ) with σ ∈ F256^{m−yr}. Every form of that is F256
work: the closed form is 128 × (m − yr_log) F256 multiplies per claim
(~4k F256 ≈ 12k F128 MAC rows for two claims, plus 6.4k squaring
chains); the assist re-run at an F256 point triples its 3.2k
square-root chains and 3.2k prefix products. The Frobenius trick that
keeps the residual side cheap (yr is F128-valued per split coordinate,
so ŷr(z^{2^j}) = ŷr(z)^{2^j}) does not help the bound coordinates. In
the recursive verifier those rows are extension-field
multiply-accumulates — type el701 — and the live census of
`chain_tower_e2e_with_lane` today reads
`el701 16384/16384` (el0 spine 9708, el600 mac 12316, el700 126):
the type is AT its 2^14 ceiling, the same ceiling the four-level ladder
overflowed by 774 rows. The fusion needs thousands there. The union's
ν is shared by every slot, so ν = 15 doubles the node. No F128-point
formulation exists: the moment W (or W′) is the Ligerito basis, its MLE
is needed at the F256 challenges; the 25 F128 transport rounds are
exactly the price of keeping the assist at an F128 point.

Net: −11 ms (2%) of prover against an unlandable recursive verifier at
ν = 14. Not built; parked behind a residual-gate redesign or ν = 15.

What is still open on the F128 side of the transport tax (~13 ms at
m=32 after stage 1): the C-claim bit-bank fold (12.6 ms, the stripe
kernel at its lookup rate) could share ONE sweep with the lincheck's
AB fold via a two-point sum table (32-byte entries, one lookup per
byte for both points) — a kernel variant, est. −8..−9 ms if the fused
lookup costs ~1.3× a single one; the q′ fold (5 ms) and the ladder's
seed sweep (4 ms) are at the F128-multiply rate and have no cheaper
form.

### IN PROGRESS: full fusion, phase A (prover + native verifier) — checkpoint 2026-09-05

Reversal of the adjudication above, on the user's push: the recursive
verifier CAN take the fusion. Two facts changed the picture. (1) el701 is
the residual-consistency row type (per query per 8-word chunk) and the
basis never enters the query checks, so it stays at 16384 untouched; the
fused verifier's F256 products are multiply-adds in SPINE form (el700,
126 live of 16384) and its Frobenius twists act on the base-field claim
point only (F128 squaring chains, el0, roughly offset by the assist
gadget they replace). (2) Under the fusion the prover DEFINES the basis,
so it uses the FULL-cube weight (q vanishes on dead columns, the target
is identical) — then Ŵ at the ladder's point is a plain product of
twisted eq factors with NO live-prefix term, i.e. count-independent: the
fused verifier needs none of the tower's deferred layout claims (today's
"count win" defers exactly the count-dependent W-side evaluations).

Built and verified (phase A): `ligerito::extension::FusedL0` (rank-1
terms + a level-1 builder) rides the statistics ladder in place of the eq
basis (`init_phase_statistics` takes `seeded: Option`, `fused: Option`;
the OOD term keeps its sweep; W′ is added to the split basis); the prover
branch in `open_batch_merged` under `rectangular_prefix ∧ lane_major ∧
initial_k + 1 == k_cols` (public) builds the unmasked terms, W′ from two
F128 byte tables (the F256 coefficients' components), and calls
`open_fused_ligerito` (label `flock-pcs-open-fused-v0`, no packed-direct
intake); the verifier branch (`verify_fused_ligerito`) evaluates Ŵ at the
residual through `recursive_verifier_with_basis_succinct`'s residual
closure (`fused_weight_residual`, Frobenius powers incremental). The
proof carries no merged rounds, no assist (`frobenius: Option`,
`q_eval = 0`, all bound by the verifier). Round trips: lib 50/50,
element-only, mixed-class tamper oracles, m6 anchors (BLAKE3 m22 is
fused; SHA2 m22 and the element fixtures stay on stage 1 — their ladder
does not bind exactly the block coordinates).

Measured so far (desktop load 30–90, NOT a clean window): proof
462,052 → 453,789 B (−8,263, the assist); native verify at parity after
the Frobenius fix (was +2.7 ms with per-j recomputation); open −3.6 ms in
the two unpolluted pairs against an expected ≈ −7..−10 from the buckets
(merged sumcheck 14 → 0; ladder sweep −4; W′ +2.5; terms' F256 cast
+0.7). Clean A/B pending a quiet machine.

Phase B (recursive verifier, `child_walker.rs` only — `real_walker`
serves the jagged tower children): tape parser with optional multipoint
region / packed-direct intake (fused label); native replay with
`running = target`, the Ligerito spine seeded from the target, no anchor;
the deferred JaggedAssertion empty (`verify_batch_merged_deferred` must
fill it — today it panics on the fused branch, which is exactly how
`chain_spine_converges` fails now); circuit: drop the multipoint/anchor
gadgets, the 25 merged-round gates and the two `alslot` descents; the
residual close-out without the eq(ρ) pd term (`query.rs`); the new
pairing gadget per RS claim from `xab_pw`/`xc_pw`: squaring chains of
the claim point (26 × 127, el0), bound products with the ladder
challenges (≈ 20 per j, el700), `s_{c0,j}` via family-H coefficients,
the two yr-half MLEs per split coordinate and their Frobenius chains,
and the F256×F128 sums as spine256 rows. Budget from the live census:
el0 ≈ 9.7k − 6.4k + 7.6k, el700 ≈ 0.1k + 6.5k, el600 ≈ 12.3k (keep the
F256×F128 products in el700), el701 unchanged.

### IN PROGRESS: full fusion, phase B (recursive verifier) — the residual twist repriced — 2026-09-05

Built so far (compiles; `chain_spine_converges` reaches the circuit
witness): the tape parser returns the multipoint region and the
packed-direct intake as `Option`s; the child walker takes fused chain
children (native replay seeds the Ligerito spine from the merged target,
no anchor, `m_mp2` from the commitment; the circuit skips the multipoint
intake, the ĝ/e_at kernel and the anchor-expect, opens the spine on an
advice target connected to the in-circuit `tgt_w`, and closes the
residual with a new pairing gadget); the residual close-out takes an
optional eq(ρ) term; `emit_family_h` exposes the γ-scaled coefficient
wires; the deferred layout export keeps its claim structure (honest
claims at a fixed zero column point) so the accumulator and merge shapes
are unchanged — the first-level fold accepts it. Real (mixed) children
are untouched.

The finding: the residual side does NOT twist for free. I had assumed
`ŷr(z^{2^j}) = ŷr(z)^{2^j}` for the residual witness's MLE (it is
base-field valued per split coordinate); that needs its COEFFICIENTS in
F2, and they are F128 words — Frobenius is F2-linear, not F128-linear.
Confirmed with a native oracle in the walker (`TEMPORARY PROBE`): the
Frobenius-trick twin disagrees with `pcs::fused_weight_residual`; the
direct per-position form agrees for both children (rs and scalar-group
parts separately). The cheapest exact in-circuit form is the monomial
one: `ŷr(z^{2^j}) = Σ_S Y_S·m_S^{2^j}` with `Y_S` the F2-combinations
of the yr words (free) and `m_S` the 2^{yr_log−1} residual monomials, so
per claim `Σ_{c0,S} Y_{c0,S}·Σ_j g_j·(κ_{c0} m_S)^{2^j}`: 32 squaring
chains (4.1k rows) + 4.1k F256×F128 MACs on top of the point chains
(20 coords, 2.5k) and the bound prefixes. Two claims ≈ 23k new rows
against the ≈ 14.5k the assist and merged rounds free (incl. the 8,128
el701 value-twist rows): net ≈ +8.5k rows per chain child (≈ +12% of
the region), and it fits the 2^14 type ceilings only by splitting the
chains and MACs across el700/el701/el0 (el700 ≈ 12k of 16k, el701 ≈
12.5k, el0 ≈ 9k) — feasible, tight, and still to be built and debugged.

Against it: leaf prover −7..−11 ms est. (clean A/B pending a quiet
machine), proof −8,263 B, native verify ≈ parity. Decision handed back
to Benedikt; the tree holds phase A + this partial phase B as WIP.

### MEASURED: the fusion's leaf number, and a witgen cold-page hazard on this desktop — 2026-09-05

Quiet-window A/B (a waiter ran it at 1-min load 3.3; 5 pairs, grind-free,
min of 3 proves), fused (phase A) vs stage 1 (`base5`):
open 108.0/106.6/106.2/104.1/107.0 vs 115.8/118.6/110.8/106.6/110.1 —
fused wins 5/5, mean −6.0 ms. Totals went the OTHER way 5/5 (+16 ms
mean). Steady-state A/B (bench knob `BLAKE3_RUNS=8`, min over 8 proves;
both arms rebuilt with the same bench file): witgen 56 vs 36 ms (3/3),
open −5 mean, commit / zc+lc / C fold equal — the whole loss is witgen,
whose code is identical in both trees.

Hunt (all same-binary, a prover-only `FLOCK_NO_FUSION` probe since
stripped): the pool's big-class takes and misses are identical in both
modes at steady state (three witness takes from the 2^25.5/2^26 classes,
four 2^25.5 misses in the open — 3 GB of fresh mappings per prove, same
both ways); the eviction traces are identical (≈20 evictions per prove
pair, 3–4 in the 2^25 class); kernel decompression deltas are within the
desktop's noise. The discriminator was a page-touch probe on the three
witness buffers right after witgen takes them: 3–4.5 ms after a stage-1
open, 44–100 ms after a fused open, same binary, same process. The
buffers arrive COLD: this box holds ≈ 27 GB in the memory compressor
(34 GB RAM, load 10–90 all day), idle pooled pages get compressed, and
`try_take_f128` hands out the OLDEST equal-capacity buffer. A one-line
"most recently returned first" tie-break FLIPPED it (fused touch 22–25,
stage-1 touch 55–65, totals reversed by 40–100 ms) — so this is a
pool-order accident amplified by memory pressure, not a property of
either transport; reverted, nothing to fix in the pool.

LESSON (benchmark discipline): on this desktop the witgen phase can
swing ±20–60 ms per prove from which pooled buffer it receives; a change
that alters the open's buffer traffic changes that lottery. Compare the
phase you changed (per-phase buckets), and use the page-touch probe when
a phase you did not touch moves.

Verdict on the fusion's leaf: open −5..−8 ms (≈ 1–1.5%), less than the
−11 estimate — the 513-term F256 ladder rounds, the F256 W′ build and
the terms' F256 cast cost ≈ 5 ms the estimate underpriced. Proof
−8,263 B, native verify at parity. The recursive-verifier gadget (above)
would add ≈ +8.5k rows per chain child. Decision stays with Benedikt.

### PARKED: the full fusion — code reverted to stage 1, patch saved — 2026-09-05

Benedikt's call on the measured numbers: open −5..−8 ms (1–1.5%),
proof −8 KB, native verify at parity, against ≈ +8.5k rows per chain
child in the recursive verifier and several more hours to finish the
monomial residual gadget. The code of phases A and B (25b62fd, caa80cd)
is reverted to the stage-1 tree; the write-up stays here and in the
LaTeX doc; the diff is saved as `fusion_phase_ab.patch` (scratchpad,
2,976 lines) for a future tower with room in its extension row types.
The bench's `BLAKE3_RUNS` knob and the cold-page lesson stay.

### LANDED: scratch-pool retention 24 → 48 — the zerocheck's giants stop re-faulting every prove — prove best 444.5 ms — 2026-09-06

Found while chasing the fusion's witgen lottery (above). With
`FLOCK_POOL_TRACE` on an 8-prove process, the pool at steady state
holds ≈ 25 entries (a dozen small ladder/query buffers plus the big set:
witness ×3, codeword, the zerocheck's four 2^25.5-word giants, the fold
outputs), so at `MAX_POOLED = 24` it overflowed on EVERY prove and the
most-populated-class rule evicted the 2^25-class giants during the open's
gives; the next zerocheck then missed four times ("MISS (fresh)",
2^25.5 words each) and re-mapped ≈ 3 GB of fresh pages per prove —
≈ 197k page reclaims per prove in `/usr/bin/time -l`. Lifting the cap to
48 keeps the working set; peak RSS is unchanged (7.2–7.9 GB in every
configuration — the buffers exist during every prove anyway; retention
only adds idle footprint). A warm-first (LIFO) tie-break was tried in the
same experiment and is harmful in both settings (it re-routes the giants
onto the 2^26 buffers and the codeword misses instead; with cap 24 it
also cold-starts witgen at 87–101 ms): the pool keeps oldest-first.

Same binary (`FLOCK_POOL_MAX` probe, since stripped), steady state
(`BLAKE3_RUNS=8`, min), 4 alternating pairs, load 13–17:

| pair | cap 48 total / zc+lc / open | cap 24 total / zc+lc / open |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 444.5 / 150.9 / 106.8 | 540.1 / 213.7 / 111.8 |
| 2 | 462.0 / 154.2 / 105.6 | 525.3 / 194.8 / 110.7 |
| 3 | 490.2 / 165.8 / 108.9 | 545.5 / 206.3 / 114.1 |
| 4 | 490.1 / 172.1 / 106.9 | 546.7 / 185.1 / 113.8 |

Total −55..−96 (mean −68, 4/4), zerocheck+lincheck −39 mean, open −5.5
mean, witgen and commit unchanged, misses 45 → 12 per 9 proves (the
warm-up only), page reclaims ≈ 2.0M → 1.0M. Prove best **444.5 ms**.
The 2026-07-28 byte-budget experiment recorded in `scratch.rs` moved
nothing because it ranked eviction by bytes at the same COUNT cap; the
count was the constraint. Gates: fmt clean, workspace (release) 638
passed / 0 failed, tower e2e `chain_spine_converges` (84 s) and
`chain_tower_e2e_with_lane` (28 s) ok, x86 check ok.

### MEASURED: no other leak — steady-state faults 660/prove, RSS flat; the storms are the compressor — 2026-09-06

A per-phase probe (minor faults via `getrusage` + RSS via `ps`, since
stripped) on the cap-48 tree, 5 proves: at steady state the whole prove
takes ≈ 660 minor faults (≈ 10 MB: witgen 36, commit 2, zerocheck +
lincheck 10, open 611 — the ladder's small transients), and RSS holds
at 7.86–7.87 GB across proves (no drift, no leak). Zero pool misses
after warm-up (one stray 2^25.5 take per ~7 proves when the count
crosses 48 momentarily). The remaining fault load in `/usr/bin/time`'s
per-process totals is storms: one prove in the run took +52,764 faults
in witgen (824 MB, 165 ms) and +39,006 in commit (609 MB, 319 ms) while
the desktop's load hit 34 — the kernel had compressed our resident
buffers between proves and witgen/commit re-faulted them. That is the
machine, not the prover: on a box without memory pressure it does not
happen, and the only in-process mitigation (wiring the pool's ~7 GB
with `mlock`) is a dedicated-box knob, not something to land blind.

### REFUTED: wiring the pool with `mlock` — no benefit on a quiet box; prove best 438.3 ms — 2026-09-06

Benedikt closed the desktop's heavy processes (load 5 → 8–10 during the
run, compressor 27 GB → 7 GB, 14 GB free, `ulimit -l` unlimited). Same
binary, an opt-in probe pinning every pooled buffer of 2^22 words and up
(since stripped), 4 alternating pairs × 8 proves:

| pair | pinned min / med / max | unpinned min / med / max |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 442.3 / 446.0 / 498.6 | 438.3 / 455.2 / 521.7 |
| 2 | 456.7 / 459.4 / 495.5 | 447.1 / 449.3 / 464.8 |
| 3 | 457.9 / 459.9 / 497.9 | 464.8 / 466.8 / 484.4 |
| 4 | 473.4 / 477.8 / 509.5 | 475.7 / 484.3 / 515.0 |

No effect on the minimum, median or maximum (mixed signs, within ±10);
per-phase minima equal (witgen 33.5–34.4 both, commit, zc+lc, open);
pinning ADDS ≈ 63k minor faults per prove (the `mlock` walks) and holds
the wired set out of the compressor's reach permanently. With nothing
to pin against, nothing to gain — the storms of the loaded box did not
recur (max within 10% of min in every run). Not landed. The quiet-box
numbers themselves: prove best **438.3 ms** (min over 8), witgen 33.6,
commit 147.2, zerocheck + lincheck 146.6, open 101.3 — the campaign's
lowest, and the reference for the next A/Bs (`blake3_proof_base7` is
the cap-48 binary).

### REFUTED: fusing the C-claim bit-bank fold into the lincheck's sweep (two-point stripe kernel) — 2026-09-06

The idea: the union lincheck's fold and stage 1's C-claim bank read the
same 512 MB stripe with different row weights, and the C row point is
known before the lincheck runs; a two-point kernel (32-byte sum-table
entries holding both points' subset sums, sixteen NEON accumulators, one
index computation and two adjacent loads per stripe byte) would sweep
once. Built (`partial_fold_packed_z_neon_oblock_dual_padded` + dual
dispatchers + `union_bitbank_fold2` + `..._with_grinding_and_bank`,
375 lines; bit-identical to two single folds by unit test, and all
proof-byte pins unchanged).

First the regime: the production kernel at m=32 (useful bits 92·128)
runs 85.9 ms on one thread, 22.6 on four, 14.4 on eight — 6.0× at
eight, 37 GB/s of stripe. Per byte it sustains ≈ 1.4 lookups per cycle
on one core: core-throughput-bound (extract, address, 16-byte load,
XOR), not DRAM-bound; the 40 GB/s figure was a coincidence.

Then the A/B (fused vs `base7`, 8-prove steady state, min, alternating):

| pair | fused sweep (both points) | two passes (lincheck + C fold) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 25.4 | 14.4 + 13.5 = 27.8 |
| 2 | 28.3 | 15.5 + 13.4 = 28.8 |
| 3 | 27.2 | 14.0 + 13.4 = 27.3 |
| 4 | 31.0 (load spike to 19) | 15.2 + 14.4 = 29.6 |

Mean −0.3 ms; totals a wash. The second point costs its own load and
XOR per stripe byte; only the extraction and addressing are shared
(≈ 5% of the work), and halving the stripe traffic buys nothing for a
kernel that is not bandwidth-bound. Reverted; the diff is saved as
`dual_fold.patch` (scratchpad). Verdict on the transport tax: the
C-claim fold (12.6 ms) is at the lookup rate and has no cheaper form;
with the q′ fold (5) and the ladder's seed sweep (4) at the multiply
rate, the remaining ≈ 13 ms of stage 1's tax is protocol-shaped.

### MEASURED: three-way breakdown — pre-merge f035ddb / post-merge 0e973e3 / current, single- and multi-thread — 2026-09-06

Asked for before merging main again: where the time went between the
branch tip before the first main merge (f035ddb, 2026-08-27, the old
`prove_fast` R1CS-Ligerito pipeline), the tip right after it (0e973e3,
"merge main step 8", 2026-08-31, the union pipeline as merged) and the
current tip (616f322 + cap-48, `blake3_proof_base7`). Three saved
binaries from their own worktrees, m=32 BLAKE3, run in a quiet window
(load 3.5–4.7, after the desktop's heavy processes were closed), 3
measured proves each, per-phase minimum; grind off unless noted. The
pre-merge pipeline is a different protocol (one direct Ligerito open,
no ring switches, 24 KB smaller proof), so its phase labels are its own.

Multi-thread (default pool), ms:

| phase | pre f035ddb | post 0e973e3 | current |
|---|---|---|---|
| witness generation | 30.6 | ≈ 70 (outside the prove timer: bench best − prove total) | 35.0 |
| commit | 262.6 | 233.0 | 151.8 |
| zerocheck + lincheck | 118.1 + 22.1 = 140.2 | 284.1 | 149.4 + 12.7 (C-claim bank) = 162.1 |
| open | 29.5 | 240.4 | 105.3 |
| prove, bench best | **458.9** | **853.8** | **452.4** |
| prove, grind on / verify | 470.4 / 5.1 | 867.1 / 6.9 | 453.2 / 6.1 |
| proof bytes | 437,679 | 460,552 | 462,052 |

Single-thread (`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`), ms:

| phase | pre f035ddb | post 0e973e3 | current |
|---|---|---|---|
| witness generation | 234.2 | ≈ 335 (as above) | 263.3 |
| commit | 1,310 | 1,711 | 1,017 |
| zerocheck + lincheck | 1,510 + 125.5 = 1,635.5 | 1,566 (later runs ≈ 1,750) | 1,064.5 + 86.8 = 1,151.3 |
| open | 148.0 | 1,377 | 571.6 |
| prove, bench best | **3,280** | **5,250** | **2,920** |

Reading. The union pipeline arrived at 1.86× the old pipeline's prove
time (854 vs 459 ms MT; 5.25 vs 3.28 s ST) — every phase but commit
slower, the open 8× (two ring-switched claims plus the merged open
where the old path had one direct open). The campaign since took the
union prove to 452 ms MT / 2.92 s ST: −47% / −44% against its own
starting point, and now under the old pipeline on both threads (−1.4%
MT, −11% ST) while carrying the union protocol's larger proof (+5.6%).
Per phase against the old pipeline: commit −42% (leaf pipeline, 8-way
NEON BLAKE3, any-size leaf batching), zerocheck + lincheck +16% (the AG
zerocheck is faster than the old packed one, but the union lincheck and
the C-claim bank are new work), open 3.6× (the transport that the
block-first rounds and the ladder cut from 240 to 105 — the remaining
gap to a single open is the protocol, see the stage-2 adjudication).
Single-thread is the cleaner picture of work done: commit and zerocheck
both under the old pipeline; open the one phase that costs more.

### LANDED: origin/main (43f0eee) merged into the branch — phase-0 crate split absorbed, no prover regression — 2026-09-07

Main moved on by 36 commits since the last merge (8a36c91): the phase-0
refactor that splits `flock-core` into `flock-field`, `flock-hash`,
`flock-merkle`, `flock-multilinear`, `flock-parallel`,
`flock-transcript` (with re-export shims left in core), a repo-wide
import normalization (explicit import lists, `wildcard_imports = deny`
in the workspace lints, clippy `-D warnings` in CI), and the tower PRs
#44–#47 (walker_common, driver, root verifier, wire). Thirty files
conflicted; every conflict was import-shaped except the rename targets.
What had to be re-homed by hand:

- `run_hetero_chunks`, `run_hetero_chunks_stateful`, `set_utility_qos`
  → `flock-parallel` (which owns the all-core pool), re-exported from
  core so the eight call sites are unchanged.
- The 8-message NEON BLAKE3 kernel (`blake3_neon.rs`) and the any-size
  leaf batcher, serial leaf/parent hashers and prehashed-level tree
  finisher → `flock-merkle::hashing` (+ its crate-parity test);
  main's power-of-two-only dispatch replaced.
- `FLOCK_NO_GRIND` and the BLAKE3 default in `FsChallenger::new` →
  `flock-transcript`; `HashKind::default()` stays BLAKE3 in
  `flock-hash` (the one semantic divergence from main, kept).
- Stage 1's `w_coords` rotation re-applied in main's restructured
  child walker (three sites + the residual-rotation parse).
- Proof flavor: main's `FLAVOR_TOWER_ROOT = 5` collides with our AG
  flavor, now `FLAVOR_R1CS_LIGERITO_AG = 6`.
- Our benches taken whole where main only re-styled their imports.

Gates: fmt; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` clean (0 warnings);
CI's `clippy --release --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean
(25 function-local wildcard imports of ours rewritten to explicit
lists; `-A unknown_lints` locally because CI's newer clippy knows a
lint this toolchain doesn't); x86 leg (`--target x86_64-apple-darwin`,
`-C target-cpu=sapphirerapids`) clean; workspace release tests
644 passed / 0 failed / 78 ignored; tower `chain_spine_converges`
(100 s), `chain_tower_e2e_with_lane` (30 s), and CI's two tape pins ok.
All proof-byte pins unchanged (no fixture regeneration).

Merged binary vs `blake3_proof_base7` (pre-merge control), m=32, grind
off, 8-prove steady state, min, 4 alternating pairs:

| pair | merged | control |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 439.2 | 448.2 |
| 2 | 463.5 | 460.2 |
| 3 | 475.0 | 478.7 |
| 4 | 479.5 | 476.4 |

Mean −1.6 ms, mixed signs; every phase within ±4 ms with mixed signs
(witgen 34.3–35.2 both; commit, zerocheck + lincheck, open all paired
within noise). The box was not quiet (load 9–12), which the pairing
absorbs. The merge costs nothing; `blake3_proof_merged` is the new
control.

### MEASURED: the Yukon `flock-challenge` frontier added to the comparison — GPU-assisted 1.65× us, CPU-only ≈ 10% MT / equal ST — 2026-09-07

Benedikt asked for Yukon in the three-way. The Yukon benchmark
(`eigenlabs/flock-challenge`, mac track; local checkout
`/Users/buenz/flock-snark-fast-mac`) is the old direct-open `prove_fast`
pipeline with a different statement — F128, SHA-256 Merkle, 19-bit fold
grinding, no zerocheck grinding, no union — and a **Metal GPU** commit,
GPU zerocheck fold, GPU grind and GPU keep-warm (`gpu_commit.rs`, 15k
lines; kill switches `FLOCK_NO_GPU_*`). Its leaderboard frontier is
f81bb5d (commit c35c1c4, 2026-08-27, pepedesigner): 1,851,759 c/s on the
CI runner (10 P-cores, M3 Max class, median 141 ms). The local
checkout is three weeks behind that (c576e683) and carries a codex
agent's uncommitted measurement knobs; its last local score was 630,803
c/s on 2026-08-25 and its last edit 2026-08-27 — no agent process is
running now.

Two arms built in sandbox clones (the agent's tree untouched): the
frontier c35c1c4 and the local snapshot (c576e683 + the agent's diff),
each with two measurement-only grafts (the agent's `FLOCK_NO_GRIND`
knob; the bench's duplicate global allocator stubbed, which the newer
library makes necessary). Same harness as the three-way: this M1 Max
(8P+2E, 32 GB), m=32, best of 3, breakdown min of 3, grind off unless
noted, load 3–6. The Yukon tree's breakdown pass is instrumented and
its phases sum ABOVE its wall time (MT: 379 vs 266; ST: 3.38 s vs
2.86 s), so its phases are upper bounds — compare wall times.

| | current (ours) | Yukon frontier, as the benchmark runs it (GPU) | Yukon frontier, GPU off | local snapshot (GPU / GPU off) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| prove MT, best | **438.0** | **265.6** | **383.9** | 268.1 / 414.9 |
| prove ST, best | 2.91 s | 2.63 s (GPU still engaged) | 2.86 s | 2.60 / 2.87 s |
| prove MT, grind on | 445.3 | 275.1 | 793.2 (CPU grind) | 273.6 / 386.9 |
| verify | 6.0 | 3.6 | 6.2 | 3.1 / 2.9 |
| proof bytes | 462,052 | 437,551 | 437,551 | 437,551 |

Per phase, MT (ms, min of 3):

| phase | current | Yukon frontier (GPU) | Yukon frontier (GPU off) |
|---|---|---|---|
| witness generation | 34.9 | 29.2 | 28.8 |
| commit | 150.2 | 147.1 | 231.6 |
| zerocheck + lincheck | 145.9 + 12.3 (C bank) = 158.2 | 115.2 + 12.7 = 127.9 | 124.2 + 17.7 = 141.9 |
| open | 105.9 | 74.4 | 81.5 |
| wall, best | 438.0 | 265.6 | 383.9 |

Per phase, ST (ms; Yukon GPU off):

| phase | current | Yukon frontier |
|---|---|---|
| witness generation | 266.8 | 212.5 |
| commit | 1,012 | 1,670 |
| zerocheck + lincheck | 1,055 + 86 = 1,141 | 860 + 117 = 977 |
| open | 562 | 524 |
| wall, best | 2,910 | 2,860 |

Reading. As the benchmark runs it, the Yukon frontier proves in 266 ms
on this box against our 438 — 1.65× — and 141 ms on the runner. Switch
its GPU off and the gap is 384–407 vs 438–451 ms multi-threaded (≈ 10%)
and nothing single-threaded (2.86 vs 2.91 s). So the CPU work is equal;
Yukon's CPU-only edge is parallel efficiency (MT/ST 7.4× vs our 6.6×:
its E-core helper pool drains and keep-alive spinners), and its real
edge is the GPU, which our campaign rules exclude. Phase by phase,
CPU-only: our commit is far cheaper (150 vs 232 MT, 1,012 vs 1,670 ST —
8-way NEON BLAKE3 against SHA-256); their zerocheck and open are
cheaper (F128 statement, no union lincheck, no zerocheck grinding, one
direct open against our two ring switches plus merged open); their
witness generation is 15–20% cheaper. Their proof is 5% smaller and
verifies in half the time. Note for any future ST comparison: under
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` the Yukon tree still uses the GPU (2.63 vs
2.86 s) — kill it explicitly. Binaries: `blake3_proof_flock-yukon`,
`blake3_proof_flock-yukon-wip` (scratchpad); clones `/Users/buenz/
flock-yukon` (c35c1c4 + grafts) and `/Users/buenz/flock-yukon-wip`.

### LANDED: origin/main 3877687 (PRs #48–#51) merged on top — one fixture re-pin, prover unchanged within noise — 2026-09-07

Main took four more PRs this morning (tower op-schedule #48, the span
counter #49 with proof-IO v22 → v23, R1CS base-matrix sharing #50,
the node CSC cache #51): 36 files, ten overlapping ours, all
auto-merged except the m=6 proof-byte fixtures, where both sides had
re-pinned (ours for the BLAKE3 default, main for the v23 header byte).
Re-pinned from the merged tree: the four merged bundles moved, the
header-less anchors did not; two deterministic print runs agreed.
Gates: fmt, CI clippy, x86 leg, workspace release tests 649/0/78,
tower spine/lane e2e and both tape pins. A/B (merged vs the previous
merge, m=32 grind-free, 8-prove min, 4 alternating pairs): 440.3 /
446.5 / 448.8 / 460.0 vs 443.1 / 444.1 / 443.4 / 446.2 — mean +4.7 ms
with mixed signs, the last pair under a load spike (8.9–15); per phase
every bucket within ±3 ms with mixed signs. Nothing in these PRs
touches the m=32 prove path; treated as unchanged.
